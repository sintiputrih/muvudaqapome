Amrit's piercing has since closed up but, like many young people, she plans on re-piercing it with a friend in the lead up to what's been dubbed "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>hot vaxx summer</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Belly rings were popularized in the early '00s by artists like Britney Spears, only to be deemed tacky and distasteful by popular culture a few years later. But with Gen Z spearheading the return of low-rise jeans (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>while cancelling skinny jeans</a>), exposed thongs, and other Y2K staples, the navel piercing's return seems almost inevitable, considering the younger generation's obsession with nostalgia. In fact, the hashtag "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Y2K</a>" on TikTok has over one billion views, with "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>belly ring</a>" racking up nearly 50 million.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Cassi Lopez-March</a>, founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>So Gold Studios</a> in Brooklyn, says she has pierced more navels in the past few months than in years, in what she calls a "huge boom" in demand. This, she says, is in large part to celebrities <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>like Billie Eilish and Normani</a> having one. Still, she encourages those interested in the piercing not to be trend-focused.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't think anyone should keep those things in mind when getting pierced," she tells InStyle. Another factor to consider is if a belly ring will work for your body. "Navel [piercings] are extremely anatomy dependent. It's not about the size of the person, but the shape of the navel itself." Lopez-March adds it's best to visit a reputable piercer for an assessment before getting any new holes poked in your body.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the piercing is once again in fashion, re-piercers like Amrit aren't concerned that it will go out of style for a second time. "I can make anything look chic and expensive," she says. "Fashion is cyclical, so it doesn't surprise me. Like everything, it's about how it's put together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Becca Haeger, founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>That Looks</a>, the reemergence of the trend is refreshing because she's "stuck with" hers. "I got my bellybutton pierced when I was 17, because my parents wouldn't let me get a second ear piercing — they didn't want my grandma to see it — so I got my belly button done instead and regretted it immediately," she says. "I still have a huge hole that I don't think will ever close up."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, despite the navel piercing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>becoming synonymous with a post-vaccinated summer</a>, the internet is still somewhat divided. While one TikTok user <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>quotes her video</a> as "a sign to get your belly pierced so it can heal in time for summer," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>others warn against infection</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>stretching during pregnancy</a>, which are the same arguments people made back in the 2000s. For 17-year-old Ella [whose last name is being withheld for her her privacy], this is not a deterrent but just "another reason to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>not have kids</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Britney Spears Breaks Her Silence on the Framing Britney Documentary</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ella is just one of the many Gen Z kids that view belly rings as a teenage rite of passage. But elsewhere on the internet, it has become just another trend for generations to argue about: Earlier this year, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>millennial on Twitter asked</a>, "Wait did everyone stop wearing their belly button rings and not tell me?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I saw a TikTok that said I'm too old for a belly ring," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>another person tweeted</a>, age 23.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On TikTok, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a millennial user recently posed the question</a> to the younger generation: "Are belly button rings out?" People of all ages rushed to the comments to assure her the piercing is timeless. "I have it and I'm Gen X," wrote one user. "It's a classic rebellion thing," wrote another.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For 24-year-old Gina Lin, sitting on the cusp of both generations, it's simply a confidence booster. "It's liberating to me," she says. "Why not show off your belly? My belly would be so boring without it." Gina chooses to wear a plain ring rather than the extravagant charms from the 00's that inspired her to get hers. "I've never thought it was tacky having a belly button piercing because I think it's really just based on the charm," she adds. "If you're considering doing it, do it. But know that there's a possibility that the hole won't fully close if you decide you don't want it anymore."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With the low-rise trend exposing our bellies in a way that hasn't been seen since the Britney era, decorating it for confidence or even just aesthetics is an extremely valid way to celebrate getting vaccinated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you end up deciding to get the piercing, whatever your reasoning, speaking to a qualified piercer is the way to go if you're engaging in the trend this summer. And if you decide to take the plunge, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>posting the process on TikTok</a> is a popular, but completely optional, next step.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But no matter how you feel about belly rings, or any other 2000s beauty trend for that matter, just know that Gen Z is on a mission to bring Y2K back, whether we like it or not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLSmuoyzZJudnKHGbr7Ip55mrKKau6U%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
