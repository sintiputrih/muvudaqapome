However, he also had an entrepreneurial side, as he owned a number of Papa John's Pizza franchises. In this article, we will explore how many Papa John's stores Manning owned and the reasons behind his decision to sell them.</p><p>Manning's Ownership of Papa John's Pizza Shops Peyton Manning owned a total of 31 Papa John's Pizza shops in the Denver area. He acquired these franchises in 2012, during the time when Papa John's was the official pizza of the NFL. Manning's ownership allowed him to tap into the business world while maintaining his presence in the football industry.</p><p>Selling the Papa John's Franchises In 2018, Manning made the decision to sell off all of his Papa John's franchises. The timing of this decision coincided with the NFL ending its partnership with Papa John's due to declining pizza sales. Papa John's founder and CEO, John Schnatter, blamed the NFL for the decline in sales, citing the controversy surrounding players kneeling during the national anthem.</p><p>Business Decision The decision to sell the Papa John's franchises was driven by business considerations. Pizza Hut had taken over as the official pizza sponsor of the NFL, displacing Papa John's from that position. With this change, Manning saw an opportunity to make a strategic move and divest his ownership in the Papa John's stores. This decision allowed him to focus on other ventures and explore new opportunities within the business world.</p><p>Manning's Role as a Spokesperson and Brand Ambassador Despite selling his Papa John's franchises, Peyton Manning continues to be associated with the brand. He remains a spokesperson and ambassador for Papa John's Pizza. This further demonstrates his ongoing connection to the company and his commitment to supporting its brand and values.</p><p>Rehiring the Staff The new ownership of the Papa John's Pizza shops plans to rehire the staff who previously worked under Manning's ownership. This decision ensures continuity for the employees and allows them to continue working in an environment they are familiar with.</p><p>Manning's Potential Career as a Commentator Since retiring from professional football, Peyton Manning has been courted by ESPN and Fox as a potential commentator for their NFL broadcasts. Manning's extensive knowledge of the game and his charismatic personality make him a desirable choice for sports commentary. If he were to pursue a career in broadcasting, it would open up new opportunities for him in the media industry.</p><p>Peyton Manning's ownership of 31 Papa John's Pizza franchises in the Denver area was a notable chapter in his post-football career. While he made the decision to sell off his franchises, he remains connected to the brand as a spokesperson and ambassador. Manning's business acumen and strategic decision-making have allowed him to explore new ventures and opportunities beyond the football field. Whether he chooses to pursue a career in broadcasting or focus on other business endeavors, Manning's legacy as an entrepreneur and football legend continues to thrive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6hprBlnZa7unnPmqeaZZqkta%2B%2FjJ2mnqtdpbK6wM6nZKaZnqO2r7OMqK6n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
