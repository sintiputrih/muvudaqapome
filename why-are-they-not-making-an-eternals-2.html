Similarly, Ant-Man 3 failed to surpass its predecessors' success, signaling a concerning trend for the franchise.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>These underwhelming performances have led Disney to avoid risks and concentrate on likely hits, which has affected the prospects of sequels to Eternals, Ant-Man, and Captain Marvel.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Leadership Perspectives at Marvel Studios and Disney</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Rumors suggest that Kevin Feige, the head of Marvel Studios, expressed interest in producing an Eternals sequel.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Although, Disney CEO Bob Iger reportedly believes that an Eternals sequel would be a guaranteed box office flop, leading to the cancellation of the project.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>This difference in perspective between key figures at Marvel Studios and Disney has played a significant role in shaping the decision-making process regarding the future of the Eternals franchise.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Audience Reception and Controversies Surrounding Eternals</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Eternals, Marvel Studios' biggest outing since The Avengers, garnered massive expectations but received mixed reviews and faced several controversies.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The film featured the first openly gay main character, which led to its ban in several Middle Eastern countries. Additionally, a sensitive scene between two characters raised concerns about its suitability for younger viewers.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>These controversies and the polarized reception of the movie have likely influenced the decision to not proceed with an Eternals sequel, as Marvel Studios aims to maintain a balance between creative storytelling and audience sensibilities.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Impact of the Pandemic and Shifting Industry Dynamics</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The release of Eternals in the final months of the pandemic may have impacted its box office performance, as the movie struggled to make a significant impact at the box office despite its unique storytelling elements.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Also, the evolving dynamics of the entertainment industry, including the rise of streaming platforms and changing audience preferences, have prompted Disney to reassess its content strategy, potentially leading to a shift away from sequels to less successful movies like Eternals.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Harry Styles' Role and MCU Future</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The introduction of Harry Styles' character, Eros, in Eternals sparked curiosity about the potential storyline for a sequel.
