She has continued to show her pregnancy progress via Instagram, from yoga sessions to <a href=#>TikTok videos.</a></p><p>“I’m going to be a mommy,” Quinn captioned an Instagram slideshow earlier this month. “My heart is already bursting with love and gratitude for this little life inside me. I’m humbled, awestruck and inspired. It’s already a feeling like no other that I’ve ever experienced, and all I can think about is how we can be the best parents possible. We can’t wait to start our family!”</p><p>The reality star went on to write that she knew motherhood would “change [her] for the better,” explaining, “I can’t wait to experience this next chapter together as a family.”</p><p>The Netflix personality recently told Us exclusively that <a href=#>she has been “energized”</a> while expecting her first child. “I’m feeling great,” she gushed on March 4. “I’m doing my best to stick to my routine, but I’ve noticed during pregnancy, I was low on a few things, like, vitamin D and iron. So, I’ve been taking supplements and that’s been really helping me feel great.”</p><p>Quinn was “definitely” nauseous in her first trimester, she added at the time. “I wasn’t sure what part of it was pregnancy [and] what part of it was food because I’m really sensitive to food. It was definitely heightened, and my appetite changed a lot, so it wasn’t really fun.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology grad, 41, <a href=#>secretly tied the knot in December 2019</a>. Eight months later, Quinn told Metro that she hoped to have “two boys.”</p><p>The model gushed in August 2020: “I can’t even imagine, like, trying to tame a little Christine. I always wanted two little boys just because I’m actually, like, quite a tomboy myself. I grew up playing sports, I love cars and I fly airplanes. I love all the boys’ stuff, I always have. I was really athletic growing up, I ride horses.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkvbOxxqeYp6xdmLWztdKtoKedXabCqrrNZqqtrZ6oerC6jKmjmrGSpMZur86vnKtlkpavunnBrqSpZaCesLR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
