On the face of it, they should all perform the same and differ only in the functionality they provide - however, this is not the case. The obvious pointers are power consumption, but also the ability for the manufacturer to optimize USB speed, audio quality (based on audio codec), POST time and latency. This can come down to the manufacturing process and prowess, so these are tested.</p><h3><strong>Power Consumption</strong></h3><p>Power consumption was tested on the system while in a single ASUS GTX 980 GPU configuration with a wall meter connected to the Thermaltake 1200W power supply. This power supply has ~75% efficiency > 50W, and 90%+ efficiency at 250W, suitable for both idle and multi-GPU loading. This method of power reading allows us to compare the power management of the UEFI and the board to supply components with power under load, and includes typical PSU losses due to efficiency. These are the real-world values that consumers may expect from a typical system (minus the monitor) using this motherboard.</p><p>While this method for power measurement may not be ideal, and you feel these numbers are not representative due to the high wattage power supply being used (we use the same PSU to remain consistent over a series of reviews, and the fact that some boards on our testbed get tested with three or four high powered GPUs), the important point to take away is the relationship between the numbers. These boards are all under the same conditions, and thus the differences between them should be easy to spot.</p><p><img alt="Power: Long Idle (w/ GTX 980)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph16348/87358.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img alt="Power: OS Idle (w/ GTX 980)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph16348/powerosidle.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img alt="Power: Prime95 Blend (w/ GTX 980)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph16348/87359.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The ASUS performs well in our power consumption tests and is marginally&nbsp;the most efficient of the ATX&nbsp;sized X570 models. It also stacks up well against the rest of the AM4 models on test.</p><h3><strong>Non-UEFI POST Time</strong></h3><p>Different motherboards have different POST sequences before an operating system is initialized. A lot of this is dependent on the board itself, and POST boot time is determined by the controllers on board (and the sequence of how those extras are organized). As part of our testing, we look at the POST Boot Time using a stopwatch. This is the time from pressing the ON button on the computer to when Windows starts loading. (We discount Windows loading as it is highly variable given Windows specific features.)</p><p><img alt="Non UEFI POST Time" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph16348/nonuefiposttime.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The ASUS is one of the fastest AM4 boards on test in our non-UEFI POST time testing, only fractionally slower than its B550-F Gaming. The X570-E Gaming turns the tables here slightly as it sits the best when all nonessential controllers are disabled.</p><h3><strong>DPC Latency</strong></h3><p>Deferred Procedure Call latency is a way in which Windows handles interrupt servicing. In order to wait for a processor to acknowledge the request, the system will queue all interrupt requests by priority. Critical interrupts will be handled as soon as possible, whereas lesser priority requests such as audio will be further down the line. If the audio device requires data, it will have to wait until the request is processed before the buffer is filled.</p><p>If the device drivers of higher priority components in a system are poorly implemented, this can cause delays in request scheduling and process time. This can lead to an empty audio buffer and characteristic audible pauses, pops and clicks. The DPC latency checker measures how much time is taken processing DPCs from driver invocation. The lower the value will result in better audio transfer at smaller buffer sizes. Results are measured in microseconds.</p><p><img alt="Deferred Procedure Call Latency" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph16348/dpc.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>We test DPC latency at default settings out of the box, and ASUS is certainly doing something right, with some of the lowest DPC latencies we've seen on desktop motherboards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH53f5NxZpqrpah6s7vGZqqtqpmtermBlmmcZp%2BRoravs4ympq2glaevsK3RnWSrnaaesrh7lA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
