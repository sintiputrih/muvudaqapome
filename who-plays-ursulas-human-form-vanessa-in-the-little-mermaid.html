Ursula’s human form. Keep reading to meet <a href=#><strong>Jessica Alexander</strong></a>, who absolutely killed the iconic role.</p><h2>Who Is Jessica Alexander?</h2><p>Jessica is an English actress, born in London on July 19, 1999. Before The Little Mermaid, she starred in a few projects&nbsp;such as A Banquet, Glasshouse and Get Even.</p><p>However, The Little Mermaid star explained that she is pretty much “just starting” her acting career, although she’s been wanted to act since she was 5 years old.</p><p>“It sounds so cliché to say! But there was never any doubt in my mind, because I’m not really good at much else,” she revealed&nbsp;during an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Total Film</a> in February 2022. “I’ve been to hundreds of f–king auditions, and never gotten anything. I’ve been auditioning since I was 14. I’m really just starting my career.”</p><p>And what a way to kickstart a successful career — playing one of the most famous villains in Disney!</p><p>“I used to play The Little Mermaid&nbsp;all the time on the beach,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Variety Radio Online</a>&nbsp;at the movie’s May 2023 London premiere. “It’s timeless. It relates to everyone, really. I think everyone can relate to feeling a little displaced and wanting more at some point in their life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.j-14.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jessica-alexander-2.jpg><h2>Who Does Jessica Alexander Play In ‘The Little Mermaid’?</h2><p>The English actress plays Vanessa, Ursula the sea witch’s human disguise while on land. In the original animated movie and the live-action film, Vanessa attempts to trick Prince Eric into marrying her.</p><p>Jessica explained that in order to prepare for the Disney classic role, she wanted to put her own spin on the character.</p><p>“I kind of just went ‘go big or go home’ with a character like this and just hope that it lands, basically,” she noted to Variety,&nbsp;revealing&nbsp;that the crew let her have “free rein of this character.”</p><p>As for what fans can expect exactly from her version of the character: “A lot of screaming, ferocity, a little bit of a cat fight with Ariel herself,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>HSN</a>.</p><p>She continued: “I think I’m going to develop a reputation for being a screamer, because in all my projects I’m just screaming and being monstrous! The songs are amazing. And the costumes are just unreal. I’m very excited for the world to see it.”</p><p>Love J-14?
