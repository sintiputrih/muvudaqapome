Rowe and the child’s mother live together. Rowe is the mother’s boyfriend and is not the father of the child.</p><p>The arrest warrant says Rowe picked up 10-month-old Marion Rebecca Jester-Montoya and took her to his job site. Before leaving his vehicle at work, he stuffed the child into a backpack and left her in the front passenger seat floorboard for several hours.</p><p>When he checked on the child later, he found she got out of the backpack. So he put her back inside the backpack and continued to check on her periodically.</p><p>Around lunchtime, he checked on the child again and saw she was still breathing but crying and zipped up the backpack, before getting fast food. After lunch, he then put the child — still zipped in the backpack —in his trunk.</p><p>During the last check on the child around 5 p.m., he realized the she was not breathing. Police say he then drove to 130th and Upland Ave. where he stopped and called 911. That is when he started CPR on the child, according to what he told police.</p><p><a href=# class=externalLink rel="nofollow noopener">WARRANT: Infant dies after being stuffed into backpack, left in trunk for more than 5 hours</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6Kus7XOp2SjnaOpsrN5zKilraeplnpyfIympqesmKh6tMDUn52enF2eu26uwJyiqZmToHqtscWtZKKmXam%2FtrrKZqOumpKksKx5lmahmqZdZ31zfIyaqaudo6l8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
