In September 2020, Australian magazine <a href=#>New Idea</a> reported that "they clicked right away all those years ago, but this tragedy has bonded them even more." As a survivor of cancer herself, Newton-John has been an incredibly understanding confidant for Travolta.</p><p>Newton-John personally spoke to <a href=#>ET Online</a> about the situation in October 2020, calling Preston a "beautiful person, inside and out."&nbsp;The star added, "She had a gentle spirit and I just feel so, so much for John and the children. It's hard to put into words." Newton-John said the family was "coping as well as you can imagine," sharing, "it's a private journey and I respect that for them." Although she might not speak to Travolta every day, the singer and actor said they remain close. "I send my love and support as often as I can," Newton-John stated.</p><p>Although&nbsp;<a href=#>the two Grease stars</a> may not be as close as Danny and Sandy, their continued friendship shows that they had more than just a good working relationship. In 2019, before the most recent tragedy, Travolta shared a photo on <a href=#>Instagram</a> of the two reunited in their Grease costumes for a sing-a-long reunion, writing, "Grease is still the word." In good times and bad, Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta continue to lean on and support each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma21pZYJxe9ahmK1ln6G2t7XAZqWer6Sku262zqGlZpmemXqru8enZK2qkau8rcDArGSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdnsBuuMiknGasn5muuns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
