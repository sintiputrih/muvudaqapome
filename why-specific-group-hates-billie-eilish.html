After all, her tracks mostly seem to appeal to the younger generation, and her musical style is something not everyone vibes with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, disliking Billie's music is one thing. Downright hating her, as a person and artist, is not quite the same, say fans. In fact, they have a theory that one specific group hates Billie Eilish, and they maintain that it's for one particular reason.</p><h2 id=fans-are-confused-as-to-why-and-how-people-hate-billie-eilish>Fans&nbsp;Are Confused As To Why (And How) People Hate Billie Eilish</h2><p>In a Reddit thread where a fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posed the question</a> of "Why does Billie Eilish garner so much hate," fans had a lot of thoughts. First off, they elaborate that Billie clearly has a&nbsp;ton of fans; she's inarguably "one of the biggest artists in the world" and has made millions as a result.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=bc-title-link title="Is Billie Eilish Getting Cancelled? 10 Details About Her Controversial Behavior" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Billie Eilish Getting Cancelled? 10 Details About Her Controversial Behavior</a></span></p><p>And yet, there's a lot of backlash toward Billie for nearly everything she does. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trolls have recently called her a "flop,"</a>&nbsp;her videos are always termed "controversial," and people seem to want to cancel her over lesser wrongs than other celebs have committed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So&nbsp;who specifically hates Billie, and what's their justification?</p><h2 id=this-fan-theory-says-mostly-boys-hate-billie-eilish>This Fan Theory Says Mostly Boys Hate Billie Eilish</h2><p>Despite her intensely supportive fan base (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans often defend Eilish despite those controversial videos</a>), there's a lot of negativity voiced against Billie. And fans think they've found a pattern.</p><p>One&nbsp;Redditor elaborated that the backlash against Billie is "very gender-specific," and that "most young boys seem to be apathetic or dislike her." Further, the fan states, the "gender divide" is much more obvious on social media.</p><p>The fan explained further;&nbsp;"On more female-dominated spaces such as Instagram or Twitter the majority of the conversation about her and her art is very positive and adulating, while male-dominated platforms such as Reddit for the most part detest her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their theory culminates in one simple (and kind of gendered) assumption: boys and men don't like Billie Eilish. The question is, why?</p><h2 id=why-don-t-most-men-boys-like-billie-eilish>Why Don't Most Men/Boys Like Billie Eilish?</h2><p>Fans admit that Billie has made some mistakes, and she's said some "ignorant" things before. But they suggest that mostly men/boys want to cancel Billie because anything that is largely liked by women is, by default,&nbsp;disliked by guys.</p><p>Yes, it's a sweeping generalization, but think of other examples, they say, like 'Twilight,' boy bands, and Justin Bieber. Yet another fan chimed in with, "There does seem to be this perception that if a lot of women/girls like a thing, it must be some kind of lowest common denominator [junk] for the masses."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maybe fans do have a point, because as one summed up, it would be absolutely silly to "try and make a serious argument that her music is without merit."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="All About Billie Eilish's Transformation" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All About Billie Eilish's Transformation</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqL2mr8ifoJxll6e8tryMoZitnaNir6q4y6KcZp2Zoba0tI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
