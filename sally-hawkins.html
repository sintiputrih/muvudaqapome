Growing up in South East London she developed a passion for the arts, including an obsession with black and white films. She went on to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, graduating in 1998.</p><p id=eBLQoEAt3X12 data-wc=38>&nbsp;"I love disappearing" she says. "That's what acting is. For me it's about putting on a persona, stepping into a pair of shoes. It's my face, but I'm using it as a tool for that spirit, that character".&nbsp;</p><p id=ey_UVM_15Zpz data-wc=72>Sally has gained recognition for her work in TV and film, but her first few roles were in theatre. She starred in Shakespeare's <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, as well as playing Hermia in <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>. Since then, the London-born beauty has racked up an impressive CV, tackling every genre from playing Anne Eliot in the 2007 TV adaption of Jane Austen's <i>Persuasion</i> to roles in gritty films such as <i>Layer Cake</i>.</p><p id=eW5S2vMVmmhZ data-wc=79>However, it is the love of making people laugh which threw her into the world of acting. "Comedy was why I got into acting in the first place," says Sally, who had a few roles in <i>Little Britain</i>.Being open-minded, she is always willing to try new projects, whether it's making people laugh or taking on a role in a dark drama. "You only do good work when you're taking risks and pushing yourself," she said. "And failing really badly."</p><p id=ewwduAlWmJNH data-wc=40>Yet she hasn't failed. Her performance in <i>Happy-Go-Lucky</i> in 2008 saw her win the Golden Globe for 'Best Actress'. Even so she remains modest about her talents. "I never come away from a film thinking I nailed it," she admitted.&nbsp;</p><p id=eQRd8CQQ4rKb data-wc=73>She was immediately drawn to <i>Blue Jasmine</i> because of the chance to co-star with Cate Blanchett. The two actress worked closely to create the sisterly bond in the film. "When I read the script," she said, "I knew it was special." When it comes to picking projects, she follows her parents advice. "My parents have a strong work ethic," she says "But their attitude to life, their philosophy, is: 'whatever makes you happy'."</p><p id=eB0FtIXdNgpl data-wc=40>This ethos led her to land more leading roles in hit movies like and as well as , for which she landed Best Actress nominations at the Oscars, Golden Globes, BAFTAs and SAG Awards.</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9xaGRkwKK4y7JkoZmnoLavv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
