While he has since moved from those shows, Bergeron reaped some enviable pay checks for his hosting duties, with a whopping net worth to boot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tom-Bergeron-DWTS-1.png><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>Needless to say, Bergeron’s recent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">departure from DWTS</a> — which he attributed to the casting of Sean Spicer for the show’s 2019 season — will not deal too big of a blow to his wallet. So, what exactly is Tom Bergeron’s net worth, and how did he accumulate it?</p><h2 id=h-what-is-tom-bergeron-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>What is Tom Bergeron’s net worth?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>Much of Bergeron’s $16 million net worth is derived from his work on Dancing With The Stars, the celebrity competition series he hosted from its premiere in 2005 to its 28th season in 2019. At the peak of his stint on the series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that Beregon was raking in $150,000 per episode, with seasons often airing twice within the same year.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmopolitan</a>, one such peak period for Bergeron’s hosting gig was in 2017, when DWTS aired in March for eleven episodes, and again in September for another 12 episodes. If Bergeron was making $150, 000 per episode, that means he brought in a whopping salary of nearly $3.5 million.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tom Bergeron (@tombergeron)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>While those annual earnings would account for a net worth much higher than the estimated $16 million, reports indicate that Bergeron’s DWTS pay wasn’t always as high as his non-peak seasons, with multiple annual raises and negotiations likely growing his salary throughout the seasons.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>In addition to DWTS, Bergeron hosted America’s Funniest Home Videos from 2001 to 2015. While that series isn’t quite as popular as DWTS, Bergeron’s long-running presence on AFV likely scored him handsome earnings, though a specific salary has not been revealed. Outside of television, Bergeron’s net worth has also been attributed to his real estate ventures.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tom Bergeron (@tombergeron)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=false>Bergeron bought his Los Angeles home in the suburb of Calabasas in 2005. It’s reported that he purchased the property for $1.99 million at the time, with current estimates of nearby homes now placing the house’s worth closer to the $3 million mark. Bergeron also owns a home in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, which he bought for $625,000 in 1990. Now, that home is estimated to be with $1.6 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZaSkum6uxKuenqqfo8BuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
