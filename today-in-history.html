The victims were mainly girls and young women, most of whom were Jewish and Italian immigrants.</p><p>Those in charge of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory had locked all of the doors that led to exits to prevent workers from taking unauthorized breaks, so many of the deaths occurred when employees jumped from windows to escape from the spreading flames. The incident led to stricter safety regulations and a push for improved working conditions.</p><h2>1948: Yoshiko Kawashima Is Killed</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-414156 alt="Yoshiko Kawashima" width=800 height=750 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/yoshiko-kawashima-body.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-414156 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A highly-publicized photo of Yoshiko Kawashima’s body following her execution.</span></p><p>Chinese princess <a href=# rel=noopener>Yoshiko Kawashima</a> is executed as a traitor by the Republic of China after they discovered she’d been working as a spy for the Japanese Army.
