After a televised blowout loss to IMG Academy, it was revealed that Bishop Sycamore didn't exist as a legitimate educational institution. This article explores the history of Bishop Sycamore, its controversies, and whether the team still exists today.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Bishop Sycamore High School, based in Columbus, Ohio, claimed to be a high school football team. It was founded in 2018 as Christians of Faith Academy and later changed its name to Bishop Sycamore. The team gained attention when it secured a spot on ESPN to play against powerhouse IMG Academy. However, it quickly became evident that something was amiss.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Following the game against IMG Academy, an investigation revealed that Bishop Sycamore was a scam. The team lacked a real campus and operated as an athletic sports training academy. Many of the players were older than high school age, and former players came forward to reveal that they were recruited with false promises and practiced outside an apartment complex. The school also faced legal issues and struggled with coaching staff turnover and player camaraderie.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>At the center of the controversy was the team's head coach, Roy Johnson. Johnson, who was featured in the HBO documentary "BS High," was revealed to be a scammer with a history of lawsuits and questionable qualifications. Despite his self-awareness, Johnson saw himself as the hero of the story. The documentary explores his manipulation of young athletes and sheds light on the darker aspects of his character.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Bishop Sycamore faced legal repercussions for its fraudulent activities. The Ohio Department of Education investigation found that the school did not enroll any students, have a physical location, employ teachers, or offer an academic program. In addition, the school's ties to the African Methodist Episcopal Church were severed in 2018. These legal troubles further tarnished the reputation of Bishop Sycamore.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>As of the latest available information, it is unclear whether Bishop Sycamore still exists. The school's upcoming game against Life Christian Academy was scheduled by an unidentified company. However, it is important to note that Life Christian Academy is a member of the East Coast Power Prep league but is not eligible for the playoffs. It is possible that Bishop Sycamore may still be attempting to participate in football games despite its fraudulent past.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The saga of Bishop Sycamore serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of deception and manipulation in the world of high school sports. The team's exposure as a fraudulent enterprise raised questions about the oversight of athletic events and the exploitation of young athletes. While it remains uncertain whether Bishop Sycamore still exists, its scandalous past continues to resonate in the world of high school football.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6tn55lop7ApnnAp5tmnpGhuW67xWaZoquYpL1uv9icmKanopp6pbvErGStoJVisLC606umr52iqLaiuIyfpqiskpa5rXnTnpimZaOptq24jJ6voquk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
