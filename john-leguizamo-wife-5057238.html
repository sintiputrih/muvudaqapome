He was also married to actress<strong> Yelba Osorio</strong> for two years during the second decade of his career. Read on to learn more about John and his past marriages.</p><h2>Justine Maurer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/john-leguizamo-and-his-wife-justine-maurer-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>John, a Catholic with roots in Latin America, and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Justine Maurer</a>, who is Jewish, have been married since 2003. Coincidentally, John’s character of Mauricio in 2008’s Nothing Like The Holidays&nbsp;had the same religious dynamic in his marriage. “They never said it was written for me. No one’s told me the truth. It’s too weird a coincidence,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Time </a>in 2008. “It made it great, too, because that’s my life — I had lots to draw from. My wife knows that [my family members are] all very passionate and we talk about everything and there’s no holds barred when we get together. We talk about everything and anything loudly.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In the same interview, John expressed what marriage means to him. “I still think marriage is more than a ceremony and a document. It’s definitely a commitment that two people make and I don’t know if you need all those elements to make it a marriage,” he noted. “To me marriage is a devout commitment to make things work and figure it out and fight to stay together. I think you have to really make that commitment in your soul. Both people have to.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While not much is known about their relationship, John once confessed that he has very active dreams that force his wife to comfort him. “I’m always being chased — by dogs, murderers — like an action movie,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE </a>in Dec. 2022. “She has to put her hand on me because I’m about to yell.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The couple has two children: daughter <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Allegra Sky</strong></a>, who was born in 1999, and son<strong> Ryder Lee</strong>, who they welcomed in 2000. Allegra became a student at Northwestern University beginning in 2018, which her actor father documented on Instagram, as seen in the above video.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In June 2022, John gushed about how much being a father means to him. “Happy father’s day to me!” he exclaimed alongside a picture with his two kids, seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>. “And every Dad that is present. Because It’s the most important job and most fulfilling in the world! I an (sic) humbled by the task snd (sic) inspired to be my best by my kids!”</p><h2>Yelba Osorio</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>The Summer of Sam actor married actress <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Yelba Osorio</a> in 1994. The pair acted together in the 1997 film Pest, in which John starred as the titular character. The pair went their separate ways in 1996, and it’s unclear why. Yelba stopped acting in 2014 and lives away from the spotlight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mon6dlnJq0trXZmqSoZaees6Z5lGlscGpjbXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
