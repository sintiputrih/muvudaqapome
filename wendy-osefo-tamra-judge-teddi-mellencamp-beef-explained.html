The explosive finale included a battle royal between <a href=#>Keiarna Stewart and Deborah Williams</a> and was one of the most intense showdowns in Housewives history. However, since the fight, some of Potomac's other stars have been unintentionally involved in drama outside of the show. So far, two of the show's stars ‚Äî <a href=#>Candiace Dillard Bassett</a> and <a href=#>Robyn Dixon</a> ‚Äî have reportedly left ahead of Season 9.</p><p>Amid news of RHOP's future, one star, Wendy Osefo's had a "now why am I in it?" moment with her Bravo peers, <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Orange County</a>'s <a href=#>Tamra Judge</a> and former <a href=#>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> star <a href=#>Teddi Mellencamp</a>. The beef between them was one few could've predicted, though many fans are #TeamWendy on this one.</p><p>Here's what happened.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Tamra Judge and Teddi Mellencamp believe Wendy Osefo should leave 'The Real Housewives of Potomac.'</h2><p>While it's unclear how well Teddi and Tamra know Wendy, they've likely crossed paths within the Bravo universe. However, after the "Two T's'" comments regarding Wendy's future on the show, it's safe to assume they have no danger of being friends.</p><p>On March 25, 2024, Tamra and Teddi recapped the RHOP finale and casting rumors on their podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Two T's in a Pod</a>. During the episode, they said they didn't know how several of Potomac's cast members would handle Robyn or Candiace's departures, though Candiace was the only one to confirm her exit at the time.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>At one point, Tamra asked Teddi, "What's gonna happen with Wendy?" Teddi responded by stating she believed her time on the show was up, and Tamra agreed.</p><p>"I need her to be paused," Teddi said. "I can't help it. I'm really trying to get on board with Wendy.</p><p>Tamra quickly added that, rather than "pausing" Wendy, she could be "just gone" from the series altogether. Teddi agreed, stating, "By paused, I mean bye." They then took a moment before Tamra said, "bye, nice knowing you. See you later."</p><p>Tamra's comments came after she and Teddi discussed Wendy and Nneka Ihim's feud on RHOP during the season. In a February 2024 podcast episode, the co-hosts declared Wendy "the problem" in their feud and that she should move forward with Nneka or leave the show entirely.</p><p>"Wendy is the problem,‚Äù Tamra said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Tea</a>. ‚ÄúNneka keeps trying to move forward. Wendy keeps moving backward, trying to find reasons not to like her.

While many could agree Wendy has had a tumultuous season, they felt the Two T's In A Pod hosts ‚Äî primarily Teddi ‚Äî should've sat this one out.</p><p>"Teddi saying this is‚Ä¶ a choice," one fan reacted.</p><p>"I think Wendy‚Äôs time on the show is wrapping up too, but let's be honest, Wendy is 100x more exciting of a HW than Teddi.

The accomplished doctor shared several screenshots from Teddi attempting to get her on her and Tammy's podcast to no avail, once in March 2023 and another in November of that year during BravoCon. Wendy also left a message to Teddi on X, formerly Twitter, where she called Teddi a "<a href=#>Karen</a>."<strong></strong></p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Got it.

Several users felt Teddi's response fell flat, and she should've accepted Wendy's read. Tamra, for her part, seems to be staying out of the drama, though she and Teddi released an episode of them chatting with Nneka on their podcast the same day.</p><p>Messy messy!!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLKvsNhmpqydlqR6ta3Mq5hmoqWZtKZ5056bnaFdorKtuMSnmpqloGKvprHFZpyxqJyWtq%2Bxww%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
