It is a chronic condition that:</p><p>‚Äúexpands various tissues and organs, causing them to swell, become inflammatory or damaged, and finally fade away‚Äù (atrophy). This illness is also characterized by skeletal anomalies. The pace at which symptoms deteriorate varies from person to person.‚Äù</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Keenan-Cahill.jpg alt="Keenan Cahill" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Those who have the same condition often have skeletal anomalies such as a big head, low height, and joint deformities that may impair movement. Patients may also develop carpal tunnel syndrome and have a small spinal canal. Significant visual and hearing loss may also occur, as well as a soft pouch around the midsection. The condition has no impact on IQ.&nbsp;Cardiac issues are common in Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome patients. Respiratory issues might include narrowing of the airway, which can contribute to sleep apnea and respiratory infections.</p><p>The severity of the problem determines the life expectancy of persons suffering from the illness. If the necessary therapies are not received, a person may only live until puberty or late childhood.&nbsp;Those with lesser symptoms may survive until maturity. However, their longevity is reduced since the respiratory ailments associated with the condition play a significant part in their mortality.</p><h2>As Keenan Cahill dies away, tributes flow in.</h2><p>Fans of the YouTuber were devastated to learn of his death.
