Zimmerman&nbsp;explains that his issue with the album isn’t so much about its quality, but rather what he views as Skrillex allowing himself to be a puppet for artists like Bieber, who attach their name to music written by other people.</p><p>“It’s not that I have a problem with dubstep, or Skrillex, or those guys that do things,” says Joel. “It’s that I have a problem that they enable themselves and they put themselves in these positions to be a part of… bullshit.”</p><p data-characters=116 data-current-count=116 data-injectable=false>What do you think?
