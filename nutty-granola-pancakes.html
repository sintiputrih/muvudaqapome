A hearty, filling breakfast!</p><p>If you’ve been following along on Modern Honey, you know that I have spent some time on a gluten-free and dairy-free diet in order to help with some of my health issues. I was amazed at the healing power of food! Since we are pancake fanatics in our home, I worked to create a healthier pancake free of gluten, dairy, and no added sugar. The key was it had to taste good so my kids would eat it!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nutty-Granola-Pancakes-2.jpg alt="Nutty Granola Pancakes.

My Mom’s favorite pancakes on the menu of a local breakfast spot are full of ingredients you would find in granola — oats, nuts, dried fruit, and coconut flakes.&nbsp; Since the main ingredient in these nutty granola pancakes is rolled oats, it is easy to transform them into granola pancakes.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nutty-Granola-Pancakes-7.jpg alt="Nutty Granola Pancakes.

To put this in perspective, almond milk only has 1 gram of protein per serving! I love that I am giving my kids a good source of protein and healthy carbs to start their day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolthouse Farms Plant Protein Milk is non-GMO, soy free and has 50% more calcium than dairy milk.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Nutty-Granola-Pancakes-8.jpg alt="Nutty Granola Pancakes.

It makes them a quick and easy breakfast and cleanup is a breeze.</p><h2>How to make Nutty Granola Trail Mix Pancakes:</h2><li><strong>Add all ingredients except nuts, dried fruits, and coconut chips into the blender</strong>. Puree until completely smooth.</li><li><strong>Heat a large skillet or an electric skillet over medium or medium-low heat</strong>. I like to cook my pancakes on a lower heat in order to make sure they are completely cooked in the center.&nbsp; You may use a non-stick cooking spray or butter in the pan before adding the butter. I love to use butter because it gives the pancakes such a great flavor!</li><li><strong>Pour pancake batter onto heated skillet</strong>. Have the cashews, pecans, coconut chips, and anything else you would like to add ready to go.&nbsp; As soon as you add the batter to the skillet, start to sprinkle on the nuts and coconut all over the pancake. Flip when bubbles start to form and one side of the pancake is a light golden brown color.</li><li><strong>Flip and cook the other side</strong>. Top with butter, 100% real maple syrup, and fresh berries.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Healthy-Granola-Pancakes-Recipe.jpg alt="Nutty Granola Pancakes.
