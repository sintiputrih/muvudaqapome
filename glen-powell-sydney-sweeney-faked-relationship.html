Around the same time, Glen Powell became famous thanks to starring in Top Gun: Maverick after <a href=# rel=nofollow>he almost passed on the movie</a>.</p><p>Since Sweeney and Powell were taking Hollywood by storm, they were hired to star in a rom-com together. Powell and Sweeney had so much chemistry in that movie that fans grew to believe they fell for each other. Months later, Powell admitted that he and Sweeney intentionally made fans think they may have a secret relationship.</p><p>This article will reveal what <strong>Glen Powell said about making fans think he was dating Sydney Sweeney</strong>.

During the 2020s, however, rom-coms mostly disappeared from the box office as fans turned to Netflix and Hallmark to fulfill their needs.</p><p>In 2023, all that seemed to change since Anyone But You became one of the most successful movies of the year. Part of the reason for Anyone But You's success was that fans were fascinated by reports of how much chemistry the movie's two lead actors had. At the time, Sweeney and Powell were linked to other people.</p><p>In April 2024, the movie's stars, Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, spoke to The New York Times <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">about Anyone But You's success</a>. During that conversation, Powell admitted that <strong>he and Sweeney intentionally let fans think they may be secretly dating</strong>.</p><p>"That’s people wanting what’s on the screen off the screen, and sometimes you just have to lean into it a bit — and it worked wonderfully.

According to Powell, the energy he and Sweeney shared is exactly what rom-com fans desire most.</p><p>“The two things that you have to sell a rom-com are fun and chemistry. Sydney and I have a ton of fun together, and we have a ton of effortless chemistry.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/e-syndey-sweneey-front-deposit-back-imdb.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Sydney Sweeney's Mysterious SNL Salary Caused More Confusion Around Her Growing Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Sydney Sweeney's comments about her Euphoria salary came back up when fans learned how much she got paid to host SNL.</span><p>Since Powell stated that Sweeney was "very smart" while talking about the decision to feed into the rumors, he implied it was her idea to play up the gossip. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question. <strong>Was Sweeney happy to take responsibility</strong> for the rumor?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How much older is Glen Powell than Sydney Sweeney, according to Famous People?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>When was Sydney Sweeney born?:</p></td><td><p>September 12, 1997</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>When was Glen Powell born?:</p></td><td><p>October 21, 1988</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How much older is Glen Powell than Sydney Sweeney?:</p></td><td><p>8 years, 10 months, and 22 days</p></td></tr></tbody></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sydney-sweeney-and-glen-powell.jpg><p>While speaking to The New York Times, Sweeney spoke about her role as one of Anyone But You's executive producers. As Sweeney explained, she was involved in every phone call about how Anyone But You would be produced.</p><p>“I was on every call. I was in text group chats.

As Sweeney explained to The New York Times, she fought to make sure that the movie was promoted in a way that appealed to its potential audience.</p><p>As a part of that section of the conversation, <strong>Sweeney acknowledged that rom-com fans manufactured the rumor</strong> about her and Powell.</p><p>“I wanted to make sure that we were actively having a conversation with the audience as we were promoting this film, because at the end of the day, they’re the ones who created the entire narrative.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/th-image-template-2-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Sweeney didn't directly address Powell's claim she pushed for them to embrace the dating rumors, her comments seemed to imply that. After all, Sweeney made those comments right after Powell acknowledged they played up the rumors and that was Sweeney's idea.</p><p>According to The Numbers, Anyone But You was a huge financial success. The outlet reports that Anyone But You was produced for $25,000,000 and brought in $216,019,685 at the worldwide box office. The efforts to promote Anyone But You clearly were a complete success.</p><p>If Sweeney didn't believe that Powell's comments were accurate, it certainly seems like she would have disputed his statement. More than that, she almost certainly wouldn't have talked about embracing fans as they, "created the entire narrative".</p><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-said-the-affair-rumors-were-really-hard-on-glen-powell>Sydney Sweeney Said The Affair Rumors Were Really Hard On Glen Powell</h2><p>Since Glen Powell acknowledged that he and Sydney Sweeney played up rumors about them falling for each other, that placed several old news stories in a new light.
