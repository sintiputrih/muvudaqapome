Tim Wakefield was most known for his 17-year career with the Boston Red Sox, which spanned 1995 to 2011.</strong></p><p><strong>He won World Series victories with the squad in 2004 and 2007 and was honored with the Roberto Clemente Award in 2010. Wakefield concluded his playing career with the third-most victories in Red Sox franchise history, 186.</strong></p><p><strong>Unfortunately, Tim Wakefield died on October 1, 2023, at the age of 57.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How did Tim Wakefield die?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Tim Wakefield</a> died at home in Massachusetts on October 1, 2023, from a seizure caused by brain cancer. He was 57. Curt Schilling, Wakefield’s former Red Sox teammate, publicized his cancer diagnosis days earlier, sparking controversy because the release was not authorized by Wakefield or his family.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wakefield was born in Melbourne, Florida on August 2, 1966. He attended Eau Gallie High School before enrolling in Florida Institute of Technology, where he played college baseball for the Panthers.</p><p>During his sophomore and junior years at Florida Tech, he was awarded the Panthers’ most valuable player at first base. He set a single-season Panthers record of 22 home runs, as well as a career record of 40. In 2006, the institution retired his uniform number, No. 3.</p><p>Wakefield once led the MLB in 1997, hitting 16 hitters with pitches. He improved slightly after that and, in the summer of 1999, joined a small group of pitchers who had struck out four batters in an inning. Between 2000 and 2002, Wakefield was regularly moved from relief pitcher to starter and back again.</p><p>Wakefield made his definitive return to the Red Sox starting rotation in 2003. That season, the team advanced to the American League Championship Series, where they faced the Yankees. With the Red Sox leading in extra innings in Game 7, Wakefield gave up a home run to Aaron Boone on his first pitch of the 11th inning, sending the Yankees to the World Series.</p><p>He made amends in 2004 when the Red Sox met the Yankees again in the ALCS. This time, Boston won, advancing to the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. In the playoffs, the Red Sox swept the Cardinals to win their first World Series title in 86 years. Wakefield had a strong season the next year, leading the Red Sox pitching staff with 16 victories and a 4.15 ERA. He won his second World Series victory in 2007, despite missing the competition due to a shoulder injury.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfmqxdna6xvMSnnJ1lpKR6tbXMZq6ao5Wbtqa4w2afqK9dmbaleceeZJ2hlWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
