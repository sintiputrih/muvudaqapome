For that makeover, the sides of Scott’s head were also buzzed. Instead of short blonde hair, though, the father of three sported a much longer mohawk that was dyed a bright pink shade. <a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-4></p></a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A post shared by 𝐌𝐈𝐀𝐌𝐈 𝐁𝐀𝐑𝐁𝐄𝐑 𝘓𝘜𝘐𝘚 𝘙𝘐𝘝𝘌𝘙𝘈 🇵🇷 (@elboribarber)</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Scott first made the switch to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bubblegum hair</a> in early February. He debuted the funky color just five days after Valentine’s Day, which was an unexpected beauty move from the normally brunette Talentless founder.

Clearly, the E! star was getting bored of his brunette hair. Scott’s temporary pink phase between his two blonde dye jobs, however, was a spontaneous decision, according to Miami-based celebrity barber <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Luis Rivera</strong></a>. At the time, Scott simply wanted to touch up his already blonde hair. <a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-9></p></a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A post shared by 𝐌𝐈𝐀𝐌𝐈 𝐁𝐀𝐑𝐁𝐄𝐑 𝘓𝘜𝘐𝘚 𝘙𝘐𝘝𝘌𝘙𝘈 🇵🇷 (@elboribarber)</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10></p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>Scott Disick’s bright pink hair makeover from Feb. 2021.
