It has been rumored and more or less confirmed that at some point down the line, the company will introduce Trios Titles, and although this could seem like overkill, <a href=#>especially with the incorporation of ROH’s championships,</a> it could be a very positive move for the company. When looking at the current roster, it is easy to see how great a trios division would be, and it could arguably be better than the current tag team division.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aew-rsquo-s-trios-division-is-already-thriving-without-championships>AEW’s Trios Division Is Already Thriving Without Championships</h2><p><a href=#>Although there haven’t been any sanctioned titles</a>, AEW’s trios division has been around for a long time, with weekly TV often seeing six-man tag team matches between members of factions or close allies. Trios records are also shown during entrances, proving that the company treats trios matches just as important as any other match, and they aren’t just thrown away or pointless. Often, six-man tag matches in AEW are fast-faced, non-stop, and a whole lot of fun with an air of organized chaos at times.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Wrestlers Who Should Join Current Factions</a></span></p><p>AEW is a company that houses a lot of factions, with friendships and alliances built up over time by people who aren’t necessarily in the same group. For example, CM Punk has been associated with the likes of Darby Allin and Sting, though they aren’t officially a group. On a recent episode of Dynamite, Jon Moxley brought the Blackpool Combat Club to aid in his former tag team partner, Eddie Kingston’s feud with The Jericho Appreciation Society. These links exist up and down the card and have been carefully crafted and developed over time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blackpool-combat-club-aew.jpg><p><a href=#>When introducing an entire new championship</a>, it won’t be a case of AEW creating a brand-new division in the way that WWE had to (still do) with the Women’s Tag Team Titles, because the division is already there. Trios teams, matches, and feuds are already commonplace within the company, and adding prizes and stakes to those contests only makes sense.</p><h2 id=aew-have-many-teams-to-make-up-a-fantastic-trios-division>AEW Have Many Teams To Make Up A Fantastic Trios Division</h2><p>Just looking at the names who could make up the trios division is enough to prove how it could be a huge success. On the heel side of things, the likes of the House of Black could be a major force to be reckoned with, whilst other trios and factions such as the Gunn Club, The Factory, Andrade Family Office, <a href=#>Jericho Appreciation Society (which could have several combinations)</a>, Jay Lethal, Satnam Singh & Sonjay Dutt, and multiple variations of The Elite could all provide much-needed depth – and those are just the bad guys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things You Didn't Know About AEW's Best Friends</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jericho-Appreciation-Society-Cropped.jpg><p>In terms of current babyface additions to the division, a selection of different members from the Dark Order could compete, <a href=#>in addition to the Blackpool Combat Club,</a> Eddie Kingston, Santana & Ortiz, Jurassic Express & Christian Cage, Best Friends, Death Triangle, and several other looser alliances too. On both sides of the face and heel divide, there are multiple options for creating feuds both for the title and in non-title circumstances, which is something that has been happening for a while already anyway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aew-rsquo-s-tag-team-division-could-suffer-if-trios-titles-are-introduced>AEW’s Tag Team Division Could Suffer If Trios Titles Are Introduced</h2><p>There is no doubt that the teams on hand would provide some brilliant action between the ropes, but AEW must be very cautious with how they progress with both the trios and tag team divisions. If the trios are introduced, then a selection of those currently in the tag team division would move out of it, and they could run the risk of causing the tag division to run a little thin. Also, if a heavy focus is placed on the trios belts and division, it could end up devaluing the tag team titles. <a href=#>Having two sets of tag belts is going to be hard to juggle</a>, especially with so many other belts and a large roster, so it will be very difficult to find a correct balance.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>AEW's 10 Best Tag Teams, According To Ranker</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jurassic-Express-AEW-Revolution.webp> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the six-man action, the in-ring work is usually quicker and faster than the tag team matches, so there is a chance that fans end up preferring trios to tag teams, which would be disastrous. Either way, there are certainly enough members of the roster to go around, with the likes of the Acclaimed, Top Flight, Hardys, FTR, Team Taz, Keith Lee & Swerve Strickland, Men of the Year, and Varsity Blondes all being names who could step up if indeed certain factions switch their focus towards trios rather than tag team. When comparing the two lists of teams, the trios division clearly seems to be the superior one, but AEW must ensure that they don’t lessen the importance of their tag teams.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeRmsRuwMCgZK2dkaJ6tb7IqKpmnJmrtrS1zqdknq6Vo3qjsdOtnKtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
