We are very excited to share the news that we are pregnant. This news comes with a great deal of fear, and I hope that all mothers-to-be, in whatever sense that may be, know that I am trying to be very sensitive. You see, this miracle baby comes after two very big losses. It’s a terrifying and extremely painful experience for everyone. But the sun always rises, and I never really let go to let the universe decide when I was ready. I remember every pregnancy announcement felt like a dagger to me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Elle-King-Pregnant-Expecting-First-Child-With-Husband-Dan-Tooker-Promo.jpg><p>The Los Angeles native encouraged her Instagram followers who felt the same way to have hope. “I’m telling you, our babies come,” King wrote. “And I love you. What women go through on this journey make us nothing less than WARRIORS. So thank you for your prayers and love for our high-risk pregnancy!”</p><p>The “Ex’s and Oh’s” singer went on to joke about the irony of her releasing her latest single, “Drunk (And I Don’t Wanna Go Home),” while expecting. “I am a very sober pregnant lady,” King concluded.</p><p>She and the tattoo artist <a href=#>got engaged in October 2020</a> after one year of dating. “We rode horses up a mountain to go gold panning. I had a ring in my pocket and I was going to toss it in the gold pan and propose to @tattooker … but of course, my soulmate beat me to the punch and proposed to me the exact same way,” the bride-to-be captioned her Instagram announcement. “So I immediately got down on my knee too. I love you, Daniel. One year down, forever to go. I said Yes by the way and so did he!”</p><p>The songwriter is actor<a href=#> <strong>Rob Schneider</strong></a>’s daughter with his ex<strong> London King</strong>, and the Benchwarmers star, 57, <a href=#>exclusively gushed to Us Weekly in May 2018</a> about Elle’s singing success.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s sweet now because you don’t want to be the kid of a famous person and I’m just so glad at this point in my life I get [people saying,] ‘You’re Elle King’s dad?’” Schneider said at the time. “I’m just really happy for her that she’s really getting to a good place creatively that she’s just thrilled about.”</p><p>The<a href=#> Saturday Night Live</a> added that Elle doesn’t come to him for any advice, adding, “She’s got her own thing that she’s doing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaepJyaeqy1zaBkoqtdpb%2Bms82apa1lla29pq%2FToqWgZaKWtq%2BuzrBkm5mSrnq4tdOhZJ%2BhkaOwpnnDmqVmrJ%2BkuKa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
