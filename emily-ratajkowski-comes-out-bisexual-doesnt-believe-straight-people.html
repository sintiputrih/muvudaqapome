And in her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a41616069/emily-ratajkowski-podcast-interview-november-2022/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="November 2022 cover interview" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">November 2022 cover interview</a> with Harper’s BAZAAR, EmRata continued to light the fire, saying that not only is she bi, she honestly doesn't believe anyone isn't.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think sexuality is on a sliding scale," she said. "I don't really believe in straight people."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also told BAZAAR at the time that this is her first time ever being single, following her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a40795842/emily-ratajkowski-seemingly-confirms-sebastian-bear-mcclard-infidelity-cheating-split/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=split class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">split</a> from her husband of four years, Sebastian Bear-McClard. And, she added, she has "<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a41588385/emily-ratajkowski-confirms-dating-split-husband-boyfriend-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gone on dates" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">gone on dates</a>," but isn't necessarily seeing anyone exclusively just yet. (Rumors have circled in the past few weeks that she may be spending time with actor Brad Pitt, and she was also photographed kissing a man on a recent date, but she has yet to confirm anything.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The mom of one's bisexuality reveal before her BAZAAR interview came in the form of a funny TikTok trend that involves responding to a user who asks, "If you identify as bisexual, do you own a green velvet couch?" In that moment, one is meant to show off one's green velvet couch, which EmRata did, panning the camera to the couch in her living room. (She has since deleted the video from her feed.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ratajkowski hasn't further addressed her sexual preferences—and why should she have to? Still, she did tell BAZAAR that her outlook on dating has changed since her breakup with Bear-McClard.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"To use the TikTok phrase, I was a bit of a 'pick-me girl' in the sense that I wasn't very good at deciding what I liked," she said. "I really wanted to be chosen. It was hard for me to go on a date with someone and think about how much I did or didn't like them. I would have been thinking about how they were perceiving me, what it meant, what they wanted from me, what it meant about my self-worth. I don't have that anymore. So now it's really fun to go to dinner with someone and be like, 'Cool. I really enjoyed these parts of them. I really didn't like these other parts.'"</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
