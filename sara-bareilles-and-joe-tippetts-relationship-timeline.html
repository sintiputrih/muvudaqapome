The moment was flawless — except Tippett <a href=#>forgot the ring</a> in their hotel room.</p><p>“We were up on a roof at sunset, the sky was on fire and we were listening to music and slow dancing, and it was like, ‘OK, now!’ ” Tippett told <a href=# rel=noopener>People</a> in June 2023. “I asked and she said yes and I was like, ‘Well f—k, I forgot the ring, I have to go down and get it!’ So then I came back up, got down on one knee, we did the deal and it was great.”</p><p>While he had been on the hunt for the “perfect” sparkler with no luck, he purchased a “cheap little ring” from a local market during their trip because he couldn’t wait any longer.

Bareilles eventually joined the New York City production as Jenna.</p><h3>April 2017</h3><p>Bareilles and Tippett attended several events together throughout the spring and summer, including the 2017 Tony Awards in June, solidifying their relationship.</p><h3>May 2021</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sara-Bareilles-and-Joe-Tippett-s-Relationship-Timeline-How-They-Met-Their-Engagement-and-More-114.jpg><p>Bareilles didn’t hold back while gushing over Tippett via Instagram.</p><p>“Thank you @joetipps for being my person. For watching the waves with me and holding me up to keep my head above the big ones when you know I get nervous I won’t find the ground again,” she captioned a smiling photo of her partner. “Stability is a trick, because it all just keeps moving, so the point is someone you like fumbling through with while you wait for the next bit of earth to show up. I like my dance partner a whole lot. You and me is the best thing I got going.”</p><h3>January 2023</h3><p>Bareilles and Tippett announced their engagement via Instagram. “Yes to marrying this man,” the “Love Song” artist wrote at the time. “It’s an easy, earned, relaxed YES.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>March 2024</h3><p>Bareilles said they were “aiming for this year” to walk down the aisle, but their wedding may have to wait. She told People, “But with his shooting schedule, I think it might be too hard to pull it together this year, so it might get pushed to next year.”</p><p>One month prior, Bareilles gave insight into their deep connection in a Valentine’s Day post via Instagram.</p><p>“I didn’t know there existed a version of loving someone where you become MORE yourself. Like, you bloom INTO a deeper you because of someone else,” she captioned a sweet selfie with Tippett. “I feel entirely loved and entirely loving — thank Goddess for the tender hearts with big beards. On and on we go forever my love.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmaKWeqOt0Z6gpaSVqHqiusNmoaidXam2sbzErausZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq1tcyeo6KmlWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
