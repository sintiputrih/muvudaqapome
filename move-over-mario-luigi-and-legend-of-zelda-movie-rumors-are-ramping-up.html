Movie</a></strong>, and want a little piece of the action. Following the former film’s resounding success, Nintendo and Illumination may have a Luigi spinoff, and a <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Legend of Zelda</a></strong> movie in the pipeline.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>Given The Super Mario Bros. Movie was such a commercial hit, such a move would surprise practically nobody. Why wouldn’t Nintendo capitalize on other wildly popular intellectual property? The rumors surfaced on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zippo</a>, so while the speculation may not be ironclad, the site has been correct about Nintendo scoops in the past.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true>It was reported that Nintendo currently has four projects in the works, one related to Donkey Kong, a spin-off about Luigi, and the other two potential features originating from The Legend of Zelda franchise. The Luigi spin-off is something that Luigi voice actor in the recent film, Charlie Day, has hinted that he would be interested in, in particular focusing on the haunted mansion game, telling <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ComicBook</a>:</p><p>“Yeah, my son was just playing&nbsp;Luigi’s Mansion&nbsp;the other day on his Switch. Look, I’m thrilled to get the opportunity, I grew up playing Super Mario Brothers as did everyone I know so, we’ll see! It’s like anything else in life, I’ll go if I’m invited!”</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>This is one of the more well-known games that sees Luigi off on a spooky adventure without his shorter, more famous (sorry, Luigi but its true) brother. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fans are well down for this idea</a>, particularly if it were to go hard on the horror.</p><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>In regards to the Zelda rumors, the blog states that the film would be an “amalgamation of very different Zelda games, rather than a straight adaption of like, say… Ocarina of Time, Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, etc. Also, yes, Link will speak.” Since this post though, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Illumination has come out to deny that any such film is being planned</a>, with its CEO Chris Meledandri stating “I don’t know where that [rumor] came from.”</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=false>So yet again, we must stress that all of the above are simply rumors for the time being, and ones that have already been dismissed by the higher-ups, so don’t get too invested in the idea of them becoming a reality. That said, it would seem like a no-brainer for Nintendo. After the success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, we are sure the video game publisher is cooking up some ideas about how to follow it up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopKiulWK8t7HRZqSaqpmkeq3ByKCgZpmemXqtscaepZ1ln5t6u7HLnZhmpZ%2BrtqZ50a6kqKqjYq6zsYyrmKaomaO0bsHPaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
