He was in support of many of the state’s agricultural groups who were angered with his opponent Tim Huelskamp. This was after Huelskamp lost his seat on the House Agricultural Committee. The first time in a century that a Kansan had not been on that panel. Marshall candidacy was endorsed by the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Kansas Livestock Association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, and the Kansas Farm Bureau an affiliate of the American Farm Bureau Federation.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=roger-marshall-politician></span><span>Roger Marshall Politician</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marshall ran against Tim Huelskamp for the Kansas 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Huelskamp’s campaign said that Marshall had attacked a neighbor with his truck. He was charged with two offenses, pleading guilty to the lesser of the two charges. Marshall defeated Huelskamp in the Republican primary.</p><p>On August 2, 2016, Marshall defeated Huelskamp in the Republican primary, 56 percent to 44 percent. No Democrat even filed to run. However, any Democratic candidate would have faced nearly impossible odds. The district had a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+24, tied for the 19th-most Republican district in the nation, and the Democrats had only garnered as much as 30 percent of the vote twice since 1992. In the general election, Marshall won handily, defeating independent Alan LaPolice and Libertarian Kerry Burt with 65.9 percent of the vote.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-roger-marshall></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Roger Marshall</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-roger-marshall></span><span>Who is Roger Marshall?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marshall is an American politician.
