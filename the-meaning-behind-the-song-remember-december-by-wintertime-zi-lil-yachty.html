The references to cold as the winter, getting a million, and speaking nothing but facts all speak to their commitment to success and authenticity.</p><p>Lil Yachty’s verse adds depth to the song, discussing his rise to fame and the challenges he faces along the way. He addresses the critics and expresses his trust issues with others, highlighting that he relies on his own determination and skill to succeed. He acknowledges his growing fanbase and the attention he receives from others, but ultimately prioritizes his own journey.</p><p>Overall, “Remember December” is not just a catchy song but has a deeper message about living in the present, chasing your dreams, and overcoming obstacles.
