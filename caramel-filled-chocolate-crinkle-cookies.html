A soft caramel was wrapped inside&nbsp;chocolate crinkle cookie dough, baked, and my <strong>Caramel Filled Chocolate Crinkle Cookies</strong> were born.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Caramel-Filled-Chocolate-Crinkle-Cookies-9.jpg alt="Caramel Filled Chocolate Crinkle Cookies 9" width=4000 height=4333 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Years ago I watched a movie about a man who was known as the ‚Äú<strong>Candy Bomber</strong>.‚Äù It all started in Berlin, which had become a divided country after the war.&nbsp; A pilot named Gail Halvorsen watched as children in Berlin became so excited about sharing two pieces of Wrigley gum. They didn‚Äôt have much, especially not candy, and he promised the children he would drop candy on his next flight. The kids asked how they would know which of the huge airplanes was his, and he said he would ‚Äúwiggle his wings‚Äù as he approached. He became known as ‚ÄúUncle Wiggly&nbsp;Wings.‚Äù</p><p>He lived up to his promise, getting other pilots to donate their candy rations. More children started to show up to catch his candy drops. As newspapers got wind of what was happening, chocolate and candy donations began to pour in from the United States. These German children were so appreciative of something as small as a piece of gum. A small act of service by ONE man became a full-fledged humanitarian effort by the Air Force. Wow! It‚Äôs amazing to me what one person can do to make a difference in so many lives.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Caramel-Filled-Chocolate-Crinkle-Cookies-6.jpg alt="Caramel Filled Chocolate Crinkle Cookies.

My son, Mason, said that he wanted to do something like that. We became brainstorming and thought since we love to bake, we could become ‚Äú<strong>Cookie Droppers</strong>.‚Äù Obviously, we don‚Äôt have an airplane but we started to think of other ways we could make it work.</p><p>We spent two days baking up a storm, loading up Christmas bags full of cookies, and began driving around neighborhoods. We started with a&nbsp;quiet senior citizen neighborhood, filled with people who may not get many visitors or plates of Christmas cookies. The kids would set the bag of Christmas cookies down on their front porch, knock, and run.&nbsp; They would peer around the corner and see their faces.</p><p>It has become one of our family‚Äôs favorite Christmas traditions.&nbsp; It doesn‚Äôt take much time or effort but hopefully, it brings some happiness into someone‚Äôs life. Last year I shared some of our favorite&nbsp;family traditions to help feel the Christmas spirit.

These are made with a simple chocolate cookie dough made with cocoa powder.&nbsp; The dough is chilled and then a soft caramel is placed in the center of a ball. The chocolate crinkle cookie dough is wrapped around the caramel, rolled into powdered sugar, and baked. The caramel melts inside the cookie and becomes ooey-gooey.

Just make sure that you roll the dough into a ball, flatten it out slightly with your thumb, place the caramel in the center, and wrap the cookie all around it. Make sure the caramel is completely covered!</li><li>Use parchment paper or Silpat so that if the caramel begins to ooze out the sides that it won‚Äôt stick to the cookie baking sheet.
