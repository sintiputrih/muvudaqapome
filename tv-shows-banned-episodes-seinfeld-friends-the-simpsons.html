Most of these episodes air just once, but some never even make it to the viewers.</p><p>Let's take a look at some notable shows that featured banned episodes.</p><h2 id=39-mister-rogers-39-had-a-few-episodes-ruffle-feathers><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>'Mister Rogers' Had A Few Episodes Ruffle Feathers</span></h2><p>It is almost impossible to believe that someone as wholesome as Mr. Rogers would get himself in the hot water due to his content on the small screen, but this was precisely the case years ago. The show's beloved host <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">broke down the Cold War</a> simply for younger viewers, and that episode was subsequently removed from the small screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-seinfeld-39-burned-a-flag-and-was-quickly-banned><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>'Seinfeld' Burned A Flag And Was Quickly Banned</span></h2><p>There are plenty of ways to anger a lot of viewers, one of which is burning the flag of an entire country. The folks making Seinfeld learned this the hard way when they opted to burn the country flag of Puerto Rico. It was a foolish decision by the show, and the episode disappeared with a quickness.</p><h2 id=39-the-x-files-39-had-an-episode-too-creepy-for-tv><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>'The X-Files' Had An Episode Too Creepy For TV</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The X-Files never shied away from touching on serious and dark themes, and while this is what made the show a powerhouse in its prime, it also caused some controversy. In the episode "Home," a depiction of incest and deformity was too dark for many viewers, and complaints came pouring in, which got the episode banned.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Sad Reason Marvel’s ‘Eternals’ Has Been Banned In So Many Countries</a></span></p><h2 id=39-boy-meets-world-39-had-multiple-episodes-banned-from-disney-channel><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>'Boy Meets World' Had Multiple Episodes Banned From Disney Channel</span></h2><p>Boy Meets World Is about as wholesome as it gets, but even this show touched on mature themes that were too much for the Disney Channel. Underage drinking and sex were the themes of episodes like "Promises, Promises" and "If You Can’t Be with The One You Love," which were banned from the kids' network.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-south-park-39-took-on-a-religious-figure-and-caused-controversy><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>'South Park' Took On A Religious Figure And Caused Controversy</span></h2><p>Controversy has been the name of the game for this show since it made its debut back in the 1990s, and when they poked fun at a religious figure, there was a massive blowback against the show. "200" and "201" featured depictions of many religious figures, and it was the depiction of Muhammad that sparked the backlash.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Celebrities Are Banned From The Howard Stern Show</a></span></p><h2 id=39-sesame-street-39-had-a-frightening-39-70s-episode-that-was-pulled><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>'Sesame Street' Had A Frightening '70s Episode That Was Pulled</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, how did one of the most beloved TV shows of all time wind up with an episode that was banned from viewers? Well, the show decided to feature Margaret Hamilton, who played the Wicked Witch in The Wizard of Oz. Just like she was in the movie, she was scary while on Sesame Street, leading to complaints and a ban.</p><h2 id=39-svu-39-had-a-politician-related-episode-that-never-aired><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>'SVU' Had A Politician-Related Episode That Never Aired</span></h2><p>Sometimes, the writers at SVU get a little too close to things that happen in real life. This was the case when they wrote and filmed an entire episode around a politician who was dealing with scandal, and this mirrored what was going on with a notable political figure at the time. Unlike others on this list, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this episode didn't air</a> a single time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-friends-39-got-a-ban-due-to-its-adult-entertainment-theme><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>'Friends' Got A Ban Due To Its Adult Entertainment Theme</span></h2><p>Friends had several episodes that were deemed controversial, but "The One With The Free Porn" was an episode that was banned in some places. The subject matter was too adult in nature to be aired during the majority of the day, which shifted the episode out of rotation.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why 'The Da Vinci Code' Was Banned In Multiple Countries</a></span></p><h2 id=39-the-simpsons-39-banned-episode-hit-too-close-to-a-tragedy><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>'The Simpsons' Banned Episode Hit Too Close To A Tragedy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While not controversial all the time, The Simpsons is a show that has certainly gotten under some people's skin through the years. Sadly, the episode "The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson" featured the Twin Towers, and after the tragic events of 9/11, the episode was banned for a long time. It would come back on the air years later.</p><h2 id=39-spongebob-39-has-had-multiple-banned-episodes><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>'SpongeBob' Has Had Multiple Banned Episodes</span></h2><p>Talk about bad timing. A SpongeBob episode dealing with a virus was going to be featured on Nickelodeon, but given everything going on in the world, the network axed the idea. Another banned episode from years back had Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob stealing underwear, if you can believe that.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>These 'Frasier' Episodes Would Be Banned Today</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirr2Wjnby4v4ybmKemlZl6przIrKadnaNiwKa1zZ%2BcpZxdm7%2Bqsc2dqmasmJp6tLXMqaqopqNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
