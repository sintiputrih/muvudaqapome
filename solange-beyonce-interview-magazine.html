Considering Beyoncé's Lemonade and Solange's A Seat at the Table released last year, both artists boast recent <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/news/a18169/beyonce-solange-first-sisters-with-number-one-albums/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="number one albums" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">number one albums</a> that explore black identity, racism and feminism. Their music was the perfect starting point for the conversation, which included their childhood and parents, "womanism" and "growing up in a hair salon," according to Solange.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beyoncé, a proud big sister, did not hold back from gushing over her younger sibling. After calling her a "rock star," she added: "I'm so happy to interview you because, clearly, I'm your biggest fan and I'm super proud of you." She later added, "I remember thinking, 'My little sister is going to be something super special,' because you always seemed to know what you wanted."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And when she asked her sister about her inspirations to perform, Solange credited Beyoncé: "Growing up in a household with a master class such as yourself definitely didn't hurt." But she also gave their mother, Tina Lawson, some credit: "And, as far back as I can remember, our mother always taught us to be in control of our voice and our bodies and our work, and she showed us that through her example."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The two go on to talk about songwriting, comparisons between their father Mathew Knowles and rapper Master P, being influenced by their hometown of Houston, the now-iconic hairstyle in Solange's album cover and the "misconceptions about being a strong woman."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Plus, there are sweet sisterly moments like these:</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">BEYONCÉ: And, honestly, growing up, how did I do as a big sister?</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">SOLANGE: You did a kickass job. You were the most patient, loving, wonderful sister ever. In the 30 years that we've been together, I think we've only really, like, butted heads ... we can count on one hand.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">BEYONCÉ: I was expecting something funny, but I'll take it. Thank you.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They also almost shared the funniest texts they received from their mother that week, but Beyoncé thought it was "too personal."
