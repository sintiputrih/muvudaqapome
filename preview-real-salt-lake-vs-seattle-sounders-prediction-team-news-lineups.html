Salt Lake.</p><p>Currently in second, one point behind leaders Sporting Kansas City, legendary Sounders boss <a href=# title="More Brian Schmetzer"><strong class=autotag>Brian Schmetzer</strong></a> will be hoping his side can make use of one of their games in hand to climb back to the summit.</p><p>Having recovered from a mid-season wobble, the club from Washington have enjoyed a comfortable run of form, losing just one of their last six MLS matches.</p><p>On course to match their 64-point haul from when the Sounders topped the Western Conference seven years ago, Schmetzer’s side will travel to south in the knowledge they hold one of the division’s strongest away records.</p><p>Minnesota United remain the only side Seattle have lost to on the road, with the Loons running out comfortable 2-0 winners over the Sounders back in July.</p><p>Whilst they may be favourites to top the Eastern Conference, the Sounders have relied on a shrewd defence to see them through games and they boast the league’s tightest backline.</p><p>No side across MLS have conceded fewer goals than Seattle, with the side’s 19 conceded having provided the platform for their successful season.</p><p class=imgI><img

out a thrilling 4-3 encounter with San Jose Earthquakes in their last fixture, <a href=# title="More Pablo Mastroeni"><strong class=autotag>Pablo Mastroeni</strong></a>‘s men came from behind twice to secure only their third away win of the campaign.</p><p>It is at the Rio Tinto Stadium where the Claret and Cobalt have picked up their points this season, losing only twice in 12 home matches.</p><p>Mastroeni has had an indifferent start to life as interim coach at Real Salt Lake after taking over from <a href=# title="More Freddy Juarez"><strong class=autotag>Freddy Juarez</strong></a> at the end of August and the 2009 MLS Cup winners, but still in the hunt for a playoff spot.</p><p>Despite being winless in their last four head-to-heads with Seattle, Real Salt Lake will be confident of causing an upset when the two-time MLS Cup winners come to visit Utah.</p><p>The Sounders have not left the Rio Tinto with three points in their last nine visits, a run stretching back to November 2012.</p><p>Approaching almost a decade since the Sounders last beat Real Salt Lake on the road, a win against Mastroeni’s men will send out a statement for the rest of the league.</p><p>Real Salt Lake Major League Soccer form:</p><ul class=fg_results><li><span class=fg_loss title=Loss>L</span></li><li><span class=fg_win title=Win>W</span></li><li><span class=fg_loss
