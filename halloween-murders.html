That Halloween, the sadistic murderers abducted their final victim, 16-year-old Shirley “Lynette” Ledford.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Oxygen</a>, Ledford had decided to hitchhike home after a party in Burbank, California. She was picked up by Roy Norris and Lawrence Bittaker and taken to a secluded location, where the men tortured her.</p><p>As <a href=# rel=noopener>UPI</a> reports, the sadistic serial killers raped and sodomized Ledford, bludgeoned her elbow with a sledgehammer, and twisted her breasts with pliers before they strangled her with a coat hanger.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-395160 alt="Toolbox Killers Van" width=900 height=667 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/toolbox-killers-van.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-395160 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>The van that Bittaker and Norris used to abduct and torture their victims.</span></p><p>Damningly, Norris and Bittaker also recorded the entire brutal assault. As Oxygen reports, the two killers were arrested after they bragged about their string of murders to a friend, who notified the police. Their tape of Ledford’s prolonged torture was played to jurors during Bittaker’s trial in 1981.</p><p>“For those of you who do not know what hell is like, you will find out,” prosecutor Stephen Kay told jurors before starting the tape of Ledford’s torture, according to UPI. The jury sat in shock as the 10-minute tape played, and some of them were moved to tears by the audio recording.</p><p>In the end, the shocking tape helped convict Bittaker, who was sentenced to death. Because Norris had agreed to testify against his former accomplice, he was sentenced to life in prison.</p><p>But though both of the “Toolbox Killers” have since died (Bittaker in 2019 and Norris in 2020), their gruesome Halloween murder of Lynette Ledford remains one of the most disturbing in recent memory.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyprculprCdlaN6rsHRnZyrq19t</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
