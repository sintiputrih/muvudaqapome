And I said, ‘Are you joking?’”</p><p>She clarified that Gebbia, 47, and Richards are two of her “favorite” people, but they had “never” had any kind of interaction like that. “I think it all started when I put up a picture of Carlton, Kim and I,” she explained. “Those are two of my favorite girls. They’re people I’m actually friends with. And that’s where I think it all started. I’m going to make this clear, I’ve never had a threesome with Kim and Carlton, never with Kim, ever. We are just friends.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Richards, for her part, has not yet responded to Glanville’s tweet about their possibly nonexistent feud. She will not be returning for the 11th season of RHOBH, premiering May 19 at 8 p.m. ET on Bravo, but her half-sister, <a href=#><strong>Kathy Hilton</strong></a>, has joined the cast alongside sister <a href=#><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a>, the last remaining OG on the 90210 edition of the franchise.</p><p>“I’ve known Kathy for a few years, and I have a great relationship with her,” <a href=#><strong>Dorit Kemsley</strong></a> told Us Weekly in an <a href=#>exclusive interview</a> earlier this month. “I’ve got an independent relationship with her … my relationship with her isn’t really because of Kyle. We’ve got a lot of mutual friends, and I was very encouraging of her coming on. She is hysterical. I’m very excited for the world to get to know Kathy. She’s very, very funny. I think she brings a great energy to the show and to the group. And I think that everybody’s going to love to see her.”</p><p>Glanville will also not be returning for the new episodes, claiming that she was not asked back after her <a href=#>headline-making drama</a> with <a href=#><strong>Denise Richards</strong></a>. The Celebrity Apprentice alum joined the show in 2011 as a “friend” then returned as a cast member for the third season in 2012. She hasn’t been a full-time cast member since season 6.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpGjsap5xqWYp66ZobmmechmmKZlnqTBbrLIoJ%2BtoZ6ceri106FkpKGdYr%2Bqr8eaqZ2rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
