This energetic and infectious subgenre of Hip Hop intertwines a handful of musical cultures to create a sound that is uniquely its own. From the signature Triggerman beat to the explicit yet celebratory lyrics, Bounce music is more than a genre. It is a movement that pulsates with the lively spirit of its birthplace.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides the city of New Orleans, however, Bounce has impacted the music scene across the globe. It has also influenced some of the biggest superstars of our time, including Beyoncé and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Drake</a>. While the genre has been increasingly recognized and appreciated over the years, it could definitely receive some more time under the spotlight. After all, some classic tunes owe their success to the subgenre.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-birth-of-bounce-nbsp-music>The Birth Of Bounce&nbsp;Music</h2></span><p>Bounce music has roots that are deeply embedded in the rich cultural heritage of the city of New Orleans. Emerging in the late 1980s, the genre’s foundation was laid upon diverse influences. Additionally, the distinctiveness of Bounce lies not only in its musical elements but also in its close ties to the unique social and cultural dynamics of New Orleans. It thrived in the city's neighborhood block parties and clubs, where DJs and artists experimented with the genre’s lively beats.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-triggerman-beat>The Triggerman Beat</h2></span><p>A pivotal moment in the history of Bounce is the emergence of the “Triggerman beat,” sampled from The Showboys’ 1986 track “Drag Rap.” The drum pattern and distinctive rhythm of “Drag Rap” were a defining feature of the song and caught the attention of producers. Subsequently, this beat became a hallmark of Bounce, providing a rhythmic backbone that fueled the genre’s infectious energy. Producers and DJs recognized the beat’s potential and began sampling it to create new compositions.&nbsp;</p><p>The Triggerman beat is characterized by its infectious uptempo rhythm, featuring a definite kick drum pattern, snare hits, and hi-hats. Its simplicity allows for creative manipulation, making it versatile for various musical arrangements. In time, the creative reuse of this beat contributed to the evolution of Bounce’s sonic identity. Since Bounce music gained national and international recognition, the Triggerman beat symbolized the genre’s legacy. It serves as a sonic identifier, instantly evoking the lively and celebratory atmosphere associated with Bounce. In essence, the Triggerman beat stands as a vital component of Bounce and the musical heritage of New Orleans.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-king-queen-amp-other-pioneers-of-bounce>The King, Queen, & Other Pioneers Of Bounce</h2></span><p>DJ Jubilee, known as the “King of Bounce,” was crucial in popularizing Bounce during its early years.
