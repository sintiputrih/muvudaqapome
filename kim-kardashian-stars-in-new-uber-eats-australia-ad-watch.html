The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is now appearing in a new commercial for Uber Eats Australia alongside Sharon Strzelecki, a character from the series Kath & Kim.</p><p>Kardashian, 39, gave her fans a first look at the LOL-worthy commercial by sharing it via Instagram on Wednesday, November 27. The 45-second spot begins with Strzelecki, who is portrayed by Australian actress <strong>Magda Szubanski</strong>, lounging on a couch declaring her dinner selection.</p><p>She then asks Kardashian about her meal choice and the camera pans to reveal the reality star sitting on a nearby couch in a blue and white netball outfit with her initials on it, much like the getup Strzelecki wears.</p><p>“Tonight, I’ll be eating a chicken schnitty with chips and chicken salt,” the KKW Beauty founder states. Kardashian’s dish of choice is also known as a chicken schnitzel, which is very popular down under.</p><p>When the doorbell rings with the duo’s Uber Eats order, Strzelecki says “noice” — the Australian pronunciation of the word “nice.”</p><p>“Nice,” Kardashian repeats, at which point Strzelecki attempts to correct the E! personality. “Kim, I don’t mean to be rude, but it’s actually pronounced ‘noice,’” she notes.</p><p>After a few more attempts at pronouncing the popular Australian phrase (and with a little tutoring from Strzelecki) the Skims founder gives up. “I literally have no idea what you’re saying,” she explains.</p><p>“It’s the queen’s english,” Strzelecki retorts. “It’s not that hard.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though Kardashian couldn’t quite nail the widely used Australian word, she certainly had a ball working on the commercial. “Making this Uber Eats ad for Australia was so much fun!” she wrote on Instagram. “The netball outfit is a vibe.”</p><p>Several of the Selfish author’s famous family members weighed in and revealed that they were very amused by the ad. Kardashian’s younger sister, <strong><a href=#>Khloé Kardashian</a>,</strong> commented on the post using several laughing-crying smiley face emojis, and older sister <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a> left a similar note. Kim’s mom, <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>, simply commented, “Hahahahaha.”</p><p>Many of the aspiring lawyers social media fans approved as well. One called it, “The best collab EVER.” Another added: “This is the greatest thing that’s ever happened to Australia.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqShnWK4or7DmqqhoZGjerTAwKuqZqGeYrumw4yumZ6qXZqutb%2BMmqysrKKWuaqtjJqbZq%2BRqbCpew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
