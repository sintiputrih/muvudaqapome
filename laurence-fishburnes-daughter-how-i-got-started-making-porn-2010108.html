"I didn't really want to tell too many people about it because I was afraid of their reactions when I was younger. I started thinking about it…when I was 16."</p><p>Her acclaimed actor dad Laurence, 49, was nominated for an Oscar in 1994 (for What's Love Got to Do With It), but Montana explains she wasn't interested in following in his footsteps.</p><p>"I wasn't really into mainstream acting," she admits to <strong>Us</strong>. "People would ask me, 'Do you want to get into acting? Do you want to be an actress?' and I would say, straight up, 'No.'…I knew I wanted to do adult [films]."</p><p>Montana recounts that she first filmed herself having sex on camera after she turned 18. "I watched it, I liked it," she tells <strong>Us</strong>. "I was like, 'Wow, now I really want to do it,' after seeing myself…[I] just took it from there. I became really passionate after my first at-home video."</p><p>She made the sex tape now being sold by Vivid back in March, and approached the porn company with the footage herself. "I knew they had released <strong>Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton</strong> and<strong> Pamela Anderson</strong> [sex tapes]," she says of Vivid. "They are a really respected adult film company, and I wanted to go with the best."</p><p>"They motivated me in a different way," she says of Kardashian, Hilton and Anderson. "All of their [sex tapes] were leaked." She says her self-made flick has "a more fun feeling because you're seeing everything…It's me having fun." She's now in talks with Vivid to make a follow-up film.</p><p>"I absolutely didn't make this movie to hurt my parents or bring shame to my family name," insists Montana, who moved out of Laurence's home after her 18th birthday.</p><p>"This was something that I wanted to do and I think that, in time, my father will support me in my decision." She adds that she "hasn't really talked about" the film with Laurence. Her fitness trainer mom Hajna Moss-Fishburne "just tells me that she loves me and that whatever decisions that I make, she wants me to be sure about it. And I am."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"This isn't a reaction to anything that is happening with us," Montana continues. "I see how it comes across as that. Everyone's like, 'That's crazy, why would she want to do that?'."</p><p>"I hope people really like the video," she says. "I hope it does well, and I hope they want to see more!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOaraKau6SxjJ%2BgrKCSqr%2BvsdJmm5qtl53Bpr6MoaawZZlitLDAjKyrmqqkmrFuucCkoKefXaW8s7qMa2dqaGFlhXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
