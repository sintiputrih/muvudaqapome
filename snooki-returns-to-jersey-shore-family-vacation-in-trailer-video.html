The party has arrived in the new trailer for <a href=#>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</a> — meaning <a href=#><strong>Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi</strong></a> has returned and is ready to shake things up.</p><p>In the trailer for the second half of season 4, the group takes a trip to The Poconos for the first time ever and are ready to celebrate their many accomplishments. <strong>Jenni “JWoww” Farley</strong> tells everyone she’s engaged to <strong>Zack Carpinelli</strong> while <a href=#><strong>Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino</strong></a> prepares for his first child and finds out he’s expecting a boy.</p><p>However, it’s the surprise at the end of the promo that shocks everyone — the 33-year-old Chile native is back and ready to party. In fact, she literally jumps out of a cake for her roommates.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Snooki-Returns-Jersey-Shore-Family-Vacation-New-Trailer-001.jpg><p>In December 2019, the Strong Is the New Sexy author revealed during her “It’s Happening With Snooki & Joey” podcast that she was stepping away from the show.</p><p>“I have to do what’s best for me at the moment, and I<a href=#> am retiring from Jersey Shore</a>,” Polizzi, who shares three children with husband <a href=#><strong>Jionni LaValle</strong></a>, said at the time. “I <a href=#>hate being away from the kids</a>. I don’t like partying three days in a row. It’s just not my life anymore.”</p><p>Since her exit, the cast has shared with Us Weekly many times that they’re hopeful for her return — and have hinted that it could happen soon.</p><p>“She has, like, <a href=#>super FOMO [fear of missing out].</a> She’s in the loop on everything. So, to me, it feels like she didn’t quit. She’s there,” <a href=#><strong>Paul “DJ Pauly D” DelVecchio</strong></a> told Us in January. “I just hope that she comes back, and I think she will. I don’t know. We’ll see. I think she will.”</p><p>Sorrentino, 38, added that they talk to their former roommate “all the time” about possibly coming back.</p><p>“Sometimes we feel like we’re getting through to her,” he shared with Us that same month. “Sometimes <a href=#>she’ll say in group chat that it’s happening</a>, but actions speak louder than words. I guess we will see in the coming seasons! Jersey Shore is doing well, so I’m sure that we’ll have another season, but will she come back? I don’t know!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And now we know!</p><p>New episodes of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation return to MTV Thursday, June 3, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqnp5%2Bgtm6%2BxK2sq6ajYsGwecmeqaydqWLAqbvRnmSfmZ2eubp51ZqamqyZpLtutc1mq6uZmaGys3nVopuep18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
