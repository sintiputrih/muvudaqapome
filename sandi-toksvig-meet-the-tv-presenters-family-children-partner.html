The children were carried by Peta and were conceived through artificial insemination.</p><p id=e9b3yrDgF27tu data-wc=28>All three children have the same donor, Christopher Lloyd-Pack, who is the younger brother of the late Vicar of Dibley and Only Fools and Horses actor Roger Lloyd-Pack.</p><p id=eHbr1-cO7ar1G data-wc=50>In an interview with The Guardian, eldest child Jesse revealed that she and her sibling saw Christopher more like an uncle than a father growing up. "He's a massive hippy, and it was completely understood on all sides from the start that he would have no parenting role," she explained.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5kFib7rbxGEA data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Sandi Toksvig's very unique living situation with wife Debbie revealed</a></strong></p><p id=eZ26QKI5A1YZ- data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The sweet role Sandi Tokvig's daughter had in her wedding</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/be44431ff928-sandi-extraordinary-escapes-series-2-z.jpg><p id=eUSXikMwUSIgf data-wc=9><strong>Sandi Toksvig's show is back for a second series</strong></p><p id=e6YkbU0ZhD0WP data-wc=35>Despite this, Jesse said she considered Christopher's own six children as her half-siblings and revealed that as a youngster she would even joke that her half-brother, born just two months after her, was her twin.</p><p id=ehArgQgN7ZoXf data-wc=51>Opening up about the family's unique situation to The Times in 2011, Sandi said: "I wouldn't care if they came from Tesco. I don't care about the blood thing. They call me Mummy and I earned it.<strong> </strong>We love each other. You can't do better than that. Lots of families don't."&nbsp;</p><p id=e06_e2PZfYW7z data-wc=60>Sadly, Sandi and Peta split in 1997 shortly after the TV star came out as gay. According to Sandi, the relationship broke down as a result of the "unbearable pressures from the outside world, to stay together and be the perfect couple" following her public admission. However, the two remained on good terms and continued to co-parent their three children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/90dad49c4dc7-sandi-toksvig-debbie-z.jpg><p id=ewNhWTtaik9Wt data-wc=13><strong>Sandi and Debbie renewed their vows when same-sex marriage was legalised in 2014</strong></p><p id=ecnd18m7aPl6D data-wc=50>Sandi later found love again with psychotherapist Debbie Toksvig. The pair originally tied the knot in a civil ceremony back in 2007, and they renewed their vows when same-sex marriage was legalised back in 2014. Debbie has a daughter of her own from a previous relationship, making Sandi a step-mum.</p><p id=ekaqFHQtJl6_J data-wc=42>The family was recently extended even more when Peta, who is a foster carer, adopted a young girl of Pakistani heritage. Around the same time, Meghan gave birth to a son named Arlo - making Sandi a grandmother for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1lAEGPyk6Ajc data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2tqYGd%2FdX2SbHBwcV%2Borq%2BwyGarqKOjq7aoecyenK1lpJ2ybsDVZqernaOau7Wx0axkn5mdnrm6ecKhoKWcopq7brzAq6unnaJk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
