Jordan Net Worth: How Much Money Did He Make From Creed Movies?</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Michael B. Jordan is one of Hollywood’s most well-known performers today as a result of his numerous, wildly successful films, many of which have grossed billions (with a b!) of dollars. Simply observe Black Panther! Since Michael has been in, produced, or directed a huge number of movies that we all know and adore, it should come as absolutely no surprise that he has a huge, well-deserved net worth. So let’s break it all down! beginning with the observation that</p><h3>He has tons of Creed $$$</h3><p>He’s got a ton of Creed. Have you heard of Creed, the Rocky prequel? you know The legendary movie that earned over $173.6 million at the box office and was followed up in 2018 with a film that garnered an astounding $214.1 million? Michael is the franchise’s main character, and earlier this year, we learnt work was beginning on the third installment, for which the actor also serves as director.</p><p>In a statement, Michael said, “Directing has always been a goal, but the moment had to be right. “That time in my life, when I’ve become more confident in who I am, have taken control of my own narrative, have matured personally and professionally, and have learned from the greats like Ryan Coogler, Denzel Washington, and other esteemed filmmakers I adore, is captured in Creed III. This all lays the groundwork for the current situation. I’m excited to continue Adonis Creed’s story while carrying the enormous responsibility of being both the film’s director and namesake.”</p><h3>And let’s not forget the Black Panther franchise</h3><p>Michael portrayed the villain Erik “Killmonger” Stevens in the 2018 film Black Panther, which got seven Academy Award nominations and was the second-highest-grossing movie of the year with box office receipts of $1.347 billion. Michael reportedly made a whooping $2 million for the part, so of course he got a piece of those profits. And even though his character (SPOILER ALERT) actually passes away at the end of the first movie, he shocked fans by making a surprise appearance in the follow-up, Wakanda Forever, when Shuri (played by Letitia Wright) travels to the Ancestral Plane in the hopes of meeting her brother T’Challa (played by the late Chadwick Boseman), but instead meets Killmonger. (FINAL SPOILERS. LIKE YOU WERE.)</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Black Panther (@blackpanther)</a></p><h3>Oh, and Michael’s also an executive producer</h3><p>simply because he has so much to give! In 2016, Michael founded the production business Outlier Society, which contributed to the 2019 movie Just Mercy, which is based on the life of renowned defense lawyer Bryan Stevenson. Michael won an NAACP Image Award for his portrayal of the Harvard grad because it was so heartfelt. In 2018, the actor also starred in and produced the HBO film Fahrenheit 451, and in 2019 he worked as an executive producer on both the Netflix original series Raising Dion and the animated online series Gen:Lock. TL;DR: This man is incredibly capable.</p><h3>His endorsement game is truly *chef’s kiss*</h3><p>His track record for endorsements is genuinely *chef’s kiss* and it includes a famous Apple TV spot with the late Kobe Bryant.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u7e396a15fb5dbd72e3e20df03c6ec47c><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Lori Harvey New Boyfriend: Meet Damson Idris As The Couple Makes Their Relationship Official</span></a><p>Additionally, the actor signed a contract in September 2016 to provide a character’s voice in the NBA 2K17 video game. Michael told Jimmy Kimmel on The Tonight Show, “I used to play that game a lot growing up, so to be able to be a part of it is great. He admitted in the same interview that he had incorporated his very own childhood handshake into the game, which is an accomplishment I will personally never enjoy but which makes me incredibly happy for Michael.</p><h3>His real estate portfolio is seriously impressive</h3><p>For example, he paid $1.7 million for a 4,627 square foot home in Sherman Oaks, California, in 2016. In May 2022, the actor not only listed a second 4,530 square foot Hollywood Hills residence for under $7 million (after paying $5.8 million for it), but he also paid $12.5 million for a half-acre property in Encino. Never could the $12.50 in my own bank account.</p><h3>So what is Michael B. Jordan’s net worth, in total?</h3><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, that would be $25 million. If I were Michael, after talking to my accountant, I’d probably look like this:</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
