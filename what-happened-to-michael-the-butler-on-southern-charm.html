Naturally we were all devastated to learn that Michael the Butler had a stroke back in 2021. Thankfully, Patricia Altschul has continued to post updates as often as possible.</p><p>Read on to find out more about what happened to Michael the Butler on Southern Charm.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Michael the Butler suffered a spinal cord stroke.</h2><p>In February 2021, Patricia Altschul’s son, <a href=#><u>Whitney Sudler-Smith</u></a>, informed The Daily Dish of what had happened to Michael. “I am sorry to inform you that Michael Kelcourse, affectionately known as 'Michael the Butler,' recently suffered an acute spinal cord infarction, which is often called a 'spinal cord stroke.'"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@michaelkelcourse</a><p>Michael the Butler</p></figure><p>Whitney continued, “Although this tragedy has caused significant nerve damage and impairment, with the help of the outstanding physicians at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, we are hopeful Michael will soon recover.”</p><p>Since then, Patricia has shared updates on Michael’s condition via Twitter and Instagram. In March 2021, Patricia tweeted, “He is working hard at his rehabilitation at the Shepherd Center and is actually teaching other patients how to cook. He suffered a spinal stroke which is actually quite rare but has a positive outlook and is learning how to live with paralysis.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Michael the Butler seems to be improving but is still dealing with the effects of his stroke.</h2><p>Although he seems to be on the up and up, it’s clear that our beloved <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Michael the Butler</u></a> will not be able to lead the same life he once did. In Patricia’s April 2021 Instagram update, she shared, “Michael has made many good friends while at the amazing Shepherd Center. Tomorrow he will be transferred to an interim place with assisted living in order to continue with his rehabilitation. Everyone loves #michaelthebutler.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Patricia Altschul (@pataltschul)</a></p></figure><p>Patricia has also offered up a way for fans to send positive messages to Michael through the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Caring Bridge</a> app. On his page, we can see how many fans have sent Michael kind messages and how those messages have been a constant source of inspiration for him to keep improving.</p><p>And don't worry about Michael’s sweet 15-year-old cat!
