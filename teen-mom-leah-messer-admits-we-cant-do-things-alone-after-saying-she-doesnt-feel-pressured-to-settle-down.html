class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>TEEN Mom Leah Messer admitted that ‘we can’t do things alone’ in a quote on her Instagram Stories after she said she ‘doesn’t feel pressured to settle down.’</p><p>The <a href=#>MTV</a> star shared the conflicting message following Tuesday night’s episode of Teen Mom 2 where she revealed that she’s enjoying being single.</p><img

quote read: “Sometimes the bravest thing we can do is admit that we can’t do it alone.”</p><p>On the contrary, <a href=#>Leah</a>, 29, told cameras that she is comfortable with her single status.</p><p>In the episode, the reality star <a href=#>chatted with her daughters about her love life</a>.</p><p>The mom-of-three set up an at home nail salon and takes on nail technician duties for her girls, Ali and Aleeah, 11, and Addie, eight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

comes up ahead of an upcoming doctor’s appointment about a tumor on her breast.</p><p>She declared herself a “girl mom” before Addie corrects her to say she’s a “woman, not a girl.”</p><p>Leah then pressed Aleeah about her “crush” and asked if the tween is “missing your crush.”</p><p>Aleeah turned the tables on her mom and asks “what about your crushes?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000620099975-1.jpg> <img

you trying to tell me to date Aleeah,” the Teen Mom asked.</p><p>Aleeah responded: “You do need to go on a date soon, you need to actually find someone nice.”</p><p>When Leah asked her daughter: “What would be the benefit of me dating?”</p><p>Aleeah said she would have someone help her “take out the trash.”</p><p>“Is that all the guys are good for?” Leah laughed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000630150789-2.jpg> <img

then Addie correctly pointed out that her and her mom successfully took out the trash every week without a man’s help.</p><p>Leah explains she only wants to bring a “positive role model” into their lives and even if she starts dating, the girls might not meet the guy until they got serious.</p><p>“I’m Ok with being alone too, I’ve got you guys,” she added.</p><p>The clip then cuts away to Leah speaking to camera saying she does not “feel pressure to date.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

explained.</p><p>She said she hopes she show them an “example of a healthy relationship” so they “can hopefully to do it differently to what I did.”</p><p>Leah was previously married to her twins Ali and Aleeah’s father, Corey Simms, 31, and her youngest child Addie’s father, Jeremy Calvert, 32.</p><p>Last month, the TV personality <a href=#>ruled out ever getting back together with either of her ex-husbands</a> but remains committed to co-parenting with them.</p><p>During a Q&A on her Instagram stories, fans asked her about dating and marriage – which she vowed never to do again.</p><img

fan asked if she would ever consider getting back together with Jeremy and Leah was very adamant in her response.</p><p>“This will NEVER happen!” Leah replied, before adding, “Jeremy is Adalynn’s dad, just as Corey is the twins’ dad.</p><p>“We all get along very well and put our daughter’s best interest first. I prefer to keep it that way.</p><p>“I will always wish them the best in life.”</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Teen Mom 2</a>&nbsp;star then told a fan she would “probably not” get married again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000620099958-1.jpg><p>She told another fan: “I’m open to dating, but I don’t think I’ll ever really get married ‘again.’</p><p>“I think it’s a lot of pressure on a relationship – for what? But who knows.</p><p>“I don’t really think this far into it. I just hope to find someone someday to be weird and old with.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000563055267-1.jpg><p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Teen Mom Leah Messer reveals her daughter Addie, 8, won’t see her father Jeremy Calvert for at least four months and hints he rarely calls</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpJqyr3nMqKRmpJWWtW65xKyqnqpdlrGutdOsZLCdXZiur8CMnaZmrJieu6i%2FjJqjqKaVYq6nwMSrZKyZqZ67qHnSoZxmnJ%2BawK%2FAjJ%2BcnqRdpb%2Bmv9KuqZ6cXam8br%2FEraulnV2ZvLi6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
