But my big boy [Samuel], I’m still doing good with him. But I think it’s going to work out in the end.”&nbsp;</p><p>Black even took it a step farther, joking that his youngest might have it out for him.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“Sometimes I’m afraid my little one is going to murder me,” he quipped. “Sometimes there’s some genuine rage in his eyes.
