Despite marrying a successful country music star, the "Moulin Rouge" star was sure to protect herself in the event of something going awry. According to <a href=#>Showbiz Cheatsheet</a>, a Kidman-Urban split would see Urban getting a lump sum of $600,000 per year that the two were married. Simple math? He'd be owed $11 million if the two split in 2024. However, there's one thing that would essentially void that clause.&nbsp;</p><p>If Urban, who has been dealing with sobriety for years, began drinking or using illegal drugs? He wouldn't see a dime from his wife in the event of a divorce. In a 2007 interview with <a href=#>People</a> magazine, Urban talked about going to rehab the year prior. His reason? "I was going to lose it all. It was like, 'If I don't choose this moment to do the right thing and do something that's going to give me life, all of the things I'm scared of losing, I'm going to lose anyway,'" he told the outlet. And while Kidman has been a huge supporter of her husband's journey, she also realizes that alcoholism doesn't just disappear. And so, she made sure to include that one specific clause in her prenup.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxlZoFxgY6sn5qcmZrAtXnCnqOemqKewbp5z6ucp62gqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
