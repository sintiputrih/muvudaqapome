He ranked second among all rookies in points and rebounds, and third in blocks and minutes. The 6’10” forward set Toronto franchise rookie single-game records for points (48) and rebounds (18).</p><p>His rookie campaign was further highlighted by an appearance in the T-Mobile Rookie Challenge at Houston All-Star Weekend, as well as NBA Rookie of the Month honors for the month of December 2005 and a spot on the All-NBA Rookie First Team.</p><p>He attended high school at Newtown in his hometown of Queens for his freshmen year, where he played with former NBA player Smush Parker, before transferring to Blair Academy in Blairstown, NJ during his sophomore year, where he played with fellow NBA player Luol Deng and earned McDonald’s High School All-American honors as a Senior, as well as New Jersey State Player of the Year. He entered the NBA Draft in 2003 but decided to withdraw his eligibility to attend college at the University of Connecticut.</p><p>In his first year at UConn, Villanueva was named to the Big East All-Rookie Team and was a member of the remarkable 2004 NCAA Men’s Basketball National Champions. This championship declared NCAA history as UConn became the only school to ever win both men’s and women’s tournament championship in the same season.</p><p>Villanueva made the announcement during a press conference at Gampel Pavilion where he was joined by UConn Hall of Fame Head Coach Jim Calhoun. He was the Huskies leading scorer in his sophomore season, averaging 13.6 points and 8.3 rebounds receiving team MVP and 2nd Team All-Big East honors.</p><p>He played his best ball down the stretch in 2004-05, averaging 18.2 points and 9.7 rebounds over the final ten games of the season and averaging 19.0 points and 9.5 rebounds during the NCAA Tournament. Villanueva led the team with 12 double-doubles on the year.</p><p>Villanueva is the eighth UConn player to declare early for the NBA Draft, joining Donyell Marshall (1994), Ray Allen (1996), Richard Hamilton (1999), Khalid El-Amin (2000), Caron Butler (2002), Ben Gordon (2004) and Emeka Okafor (2004).</p><p>Villanueva’s most notable professional highlight was recorded on the night of March 26, 2006, where he set a career-high and Toronto Raptors franchise rookie record for points in a game with 48 versus the Milwaukee Bucks. The 48 points were the 4th highest performance ever by an NBA rookie.</p><p>He joins an elite class of athletes: Allen Iverson (50 pts – 1997), Michael Jordan (49 pts – 1985), & Kelly Tripucka (49pts – 1992). Villanueva was voted 2nd in the running for the 2005-06 Rookie of the Year award, finishing behind Chris Paul.</p><p>On June 30, 2006, Charlie Villanueva was traded by the Toronto Raptors to the Milwaukee Bucks. In his first year (2006-07), Villanueva appeared in 39 games, averaging 11.8 points and 5.8 rebounds in 25.2 minutes per game.

Villanueva appeared in 76 games, averaging 11.7 points and 6.1 rebounds. Tallied a season-high 38 points and 12 rebounds at Toronto (4/9/08). He grabbed 16 rebounds twice, tying the fourth-highest rebounding game by a Milwaukee Bucks’ player.</p><p>He also made a career-high seven three-pointers in Toronto (4/9/08). In his last year, Villanueva appeared in 78 games, averaging career-highs in points (16.2 ppg), rebounds (6.7 RPG), assists (1.8 APG), and free throw percentage (.838). He led the Bucks in scoring 19 times, rebounds a team-best 27 times, and blocks a team-high 32 times.</p><p>Scored a season-high 36 points vs. Denver (2/22/09), connecting on 7-of-11 from three-point range. Dished out a career-high six assists twice. And grabbed a season-high 15 rebounds vs. New Jersey (3/10/09). Villanueva completed his first NBA contract with Milwaukee and marked a prominent status as one of the most versatile and talented big men in the NBA.</p><p>On July 9, 2009, he joined the Detroit Pistons as a highly sought after free agent, signing a 5-year deal. In his first year with Detroit, Villanueva appeared in 78 games, averaging 11.9 points and 4.7 rebounds in 23.7 minutes per game.</p><p>He started the first 16 games of the season and averaged 15.6 points and 5.7 rebounds, before dealing with back spasms issues, which limited his minutes. He made a team-high 99 three-point field goals. Scored a season-high 30 points (season-high 13 field goals made) in 31 minutes vs. Charlotte (11/11/09).</p><p>His strong play and work ethic hope to be the keys to the Pistons once again joining the league’s playoff elite. In 2010-11, Villanueva appeared in 76 games averaging, 11.1 points and 3.9 rebounds. Scored a season-high 30 points (9-15 FG, 5-7 3FG) at L.A.

This misfortune was mainly due to a sore right ankle and other injuries. Villanueva looks to bounce back to provide a positive impact in the upcoming year.</p><p>In 2009, he switched sports nationality to the Dominican Republic. Under FIBA rules, he asked USA Basketball to release him in order to switch his sports citizenship.
