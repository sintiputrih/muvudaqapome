According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Starkey’s net worth is as high as $20 million, an amount earned largely through his successful career as a musician, which started in the late ‘70s.</p><h3>Zak Starkey Net Worth $20 Million</h3><p>Zak is the son of Ringo Starr, famous drummer himself as one of the Beatles, and his first wife Maureen Starkey Tigrett. From an early age, Zak was drawn to music, and <a href=#>Keith Moon</a>, The Who’s drummer gave him drum kit when Zak was only four years old. Several years later, Zak took drum sticks in his hands and dedicated himself to playing. His father gave him only one lesson and then discouraged him from becoming a professional drummer, as he didn’t want to see his son following in his footsteps. Nevertheless, by the age of 12, Zak had already played gigs in local pubs, and become a member of a garage band called The Next. When it comes to his education, Zak went to Highgate School until 1981, when he left and devoted his time to a musical career.</p><p>During the early ‘80s, he was a part of the re-formed Spencer Davis Group, which at the time recorded jazz-oriented albums. Then in 1985 he teamed up with pianist and songwriter Eddie Hardin to record a musical version of Kenneth Grahame’s novel “The Wind in the Willows”, and until the end of the ‘80s, he worked with <a href=#>Adrian Smith</a>, guitarist of the famous heavy metal band Iron Maiden, on Adrian’s solo album “Silver and Gold”, but was also a member of the band Icicle Works.</p><p>He started the ‘90s collaborating with his father on the live album “Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band”, and with The Who’s bassist <a href=#>John Entwistle</a> on John’s solo album “The Rock”. He continued to collaborate with The Who members, primarily <a href=#>Roger Daltrey</a>, on his tour Daltrey Sings Townshend, but later joined the Who on their tour Quadrophenia.</p><p>His next project was a collaboration with <a href=#>Johnny Marr</a>, to form <a href=#>Johnny Marr</a> & the Healers, alongside Lee Spencer on guitars, and Alonza Bevan on bass. They released one album in 2003, entitled “Boomslang”, and had worked on a second album, but it was never released, as they moved on to other engagements. Starkey joined Oasis, with which he released two studio albums – “Don’t Believe the Truth” in 2005, and “Dig Out Your Soul” (2008). He also toured with Oasis in support of the released albums.</p><p>Since 2010, he would follow The Who on their tours, which also increased his net worth. Most recently, he collaborated with Sshh Liguz, forming a duo called Sshh, and the two are working on their album “Issues”, however, the album has yet to get a release date, although all album tracks have been released. The album features collaboration with such musicians as Glen Matlock, Darren Moonie, Clem Burke, Martin Chambers and <a href=#>Kenney Jones</a>, among others.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Zak has been married to Sarah Menedikes since 1985; the couple has one child together.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=11.739130434783><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Zak Starkey</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 13, 1965</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, London, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Musician, Drummer</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Highgate School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Sarah Menikides (m. 1985)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Tatia Jayne Starkey</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Maureen Starkey Tigrett, Ringo Starr</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Lee Starkey, Jason Starkey, Augusta Tigrett</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>Starkey, Zak , Zak Richard Starkey</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0823334/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25396825396825><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/zak-starkey-mn0000692895</a></td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Oasis (2004 – 2008)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Movies</td><td>Live in Boston, The Who & Special Guests: Live at the Royal Albert Hall, Superdrumming, Oasis: Morning Glory: Classic Album Under Review</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=9.6915077989601><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4.7131147540984><td>1</td><td>Was a part of another all-star cast, the Concert for New York City, when he was behind the kit of <a href=#>The Who</a>.
