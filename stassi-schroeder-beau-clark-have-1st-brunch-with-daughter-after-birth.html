Their plates were filled with food, including eggs, hashbrowns and fancy beverages. A children’s book titled, Look, Look! by <strong>Peter Linenthal</strong> was shown, as well as a parenting book, called Eat, Sleep, Poop by <strong>Scott W. Cohen</strong>.

After she confirmed the pregnancy news later that month, she revealed that <a href=#>the duo were having a baby girl</a>.</p><p>Schroeder and Clark <a href=#>welcomed their little one on January 7</a>, naming their daughter Hartford Charlie Rose Clark.</p><p>The Next Level Basic author, who <a href=#>married her spouse</a> in September 2020, did not have an easy pregnancy.

I don’t feel like myself. I don’t feel attractive,” the Witches of WeHo cofounder wrote on her Instagram Stories on December 30 along with a tearful selfie. “I feel like I have zero control over anything. I’m uncomfortable and it’s painful to move around. And my emotions are so all over the place, I feel insane.”</p><p>The Louisiana native continued, “I’ve received lots of DM’s from people telling me I complain too much and should shut up and just be thankful I’m pregnant. I’ve never been more thankful for anything. Being a mother was my biggest dream and I can’t wait to meet my daughter. But I’m still allowed to struggle with it. Why is there so much pressure on pregnant women to be superheroes? Can we stop that now?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Right before her pregnancy news was revealed, Schroeder <a href=#>was fired from her longtime job</a> on Vanderpump Rules after season 8. The former Bravolebrity was terminated alongside <a href=#><strong>Kristen Doute</strong></a>, <strong>Max Boyens</strong> and <strong>Brett Caprioni</strong> in June 2020 for their past racially charged actions.</p><p>A source told Us exclusively that <a href=#>Schroeder leaned on Clark after the shake-up</a>. “Beau has been her rock throughout all of this, and she’s been grateful to have his support,” the insider previously explained. “Professionally speaking, Vanderpump Rules and her podcast were her main priorities and she loved working on both.”</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasrJGowKp50pyfq6eVmbKzecGemK5lk6Gus7eMoZivnV1mwLV5wausp5uYYsSqwMdmm5qtl53Bpr6Mmp2tnaJir6q%2B06Fm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
