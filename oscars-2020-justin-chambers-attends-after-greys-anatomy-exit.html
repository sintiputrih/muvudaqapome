And, as I turn 50 and am blessed with my remarkable, supportive wife and five wonderful children, now is that time.”</p><p>He concluded: “As I move on from Grey’s Anatomy, I want to thank the ABC family, <strong>Shonda Rhimes</strong>, <a href=#>original cast members </a><strong>Ellen Pompeo, Chandra Wilson </strong>and<strong> James Pickens</strong>, and the rest of the amazing cast and crew, both past and present, and, of course, the fans for an extraordinary ride.”</p><p>Chambers played Alex Karev on the ABC medical drama for nearly 15 years. While his character went to visit his mother during the November 14 episode, the series has yet to further address Karev’s noticeable absence.</p><p>Pompeo, for her part, reacted to the news by sharing a Vanity Fair article that called Chambers’ exit one of the shows’ “biggest losses yet.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Truer words have never been spoken @VanityFair 💔,” the 50-year-old actress wrote.</p><p>Days after his departure news, Chambers told reporters he’s looking forward to “life, family, love and friendship” and is “very excited” for what’s next for him. (Chambers and wife Keisha Chambers share five kids: Isabella, Maya, Eva, Jackson, and Kaila.)</p><p>“Grey’s has been very supportive of me and I’m very grateful and it’s been a great ride,” he said on January 14. “Of course, anywhere that you spend 15 years, it’s a big chunk of your life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKasm5GnwG5%2Bj2tnZqKlqMGquoycn5qlkpq%2FtHnAraueppSoeqKy056pZp%2Bimsa0ecCnmK2nna56psTIrWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
