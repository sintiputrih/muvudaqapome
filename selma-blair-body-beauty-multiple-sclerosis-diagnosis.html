I am fascinated by this body and this life. I am humbled and pleased to be any inspiration for people.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This connection to her body has also paved the way for a newfound appreciation for makeup.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I’ve been made up by some of the most famous makeup artists since I started acting, and I’ve felt so transformed by their makeup that I really did become a different person. It was a superpower to me, and I mean this. Makeup is not trivial to me. If anything moves the needle for me in my life—even before my diagnosis or challenges—it is my gorgeous war paint,” she said. “I don’t mind if my muscles get caught at the intersection of a slow brain signal.

My dearest two pals came to watch the Siriano show. I walked that day. In the show. Noticing for first time, my leg was numb,” the actress wrote on Instagram. “When I first stepped out. I couldn’t feel the ground or how to lift my left leg. My brain was trying to compute. As I walked the runway, stunned.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After sharing her diagnosis with the public, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/designers/a26771468/christian-siriano-selma-blair-accessible-fashion-line-multiple-sclerosis/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Blair and Siriano" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Blair and Siriano</a> spoke about the possibility of collaborating on an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a26546417/selma-blair-accessible-fashion-line-ms-diagnosis/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="accessible fashion line" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">accessible fashion line</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Blair told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/selma-blairs-transformation data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Vanity Fair</a> in 2019, “I would like to partner with someone like Christian Siriano on a line for everyone—not just people who necessarily need adaptive clothing, but for those who want comfort, too. It can still be chic. You shouldn’t have to sacrifice style.
