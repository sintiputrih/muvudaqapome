It’s up for debate. The issue is, there are so many trendy, social media-focused brands coming out that really pique shoppers’ interests with their marketing, but fail to actually deliver. Cushy insoles flatten out within a few days of wear, uppers start to rip and tear, midsoles are clunky and and construction is sloppy. The horror!</p><p>We get it. Sometimes those fresh releases are tempting. Ultimately though, you need to do a little research. Can that new sneaker actually measure up to classic brands like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Adidas</a>, or will it be a huge waste of money? And aren’t most pairs of Adidas sneakers actually cuter and more versatile anyway? This pair, specifically, is blowing all “trendy” brands out of the water!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/khloe-kardashian-instagram-adidas-sneakers.jpg><p><strong>See it!

She posted a mirror selfie in them earlier this year, paired with leopard leggings and a sports bra as she hit the gym for a workout sesh. We all know that Kardashian could wear any sneaker in the world, so the fact that she chose this Adidas sneaker automatically shoots it to the top of our wish list!</p><p>These are the type of sneakers that don’t just hold the foot, but hug it. They have a stretchy mesh upper with an integrated tongue, eliminating any chance of discomfort there, and they have a Cloudfoam memory sockliner, plus some soft midsole cushioning. And yes, they have the signature three-stripe logo Adidas is known for!</p><p><strong>See it! Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Adidas Cloudfoam Pure Running Shoe</a> at Amazon!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>These number one bestselling sneakers have logo-adorned pull-loops at both the tongue and heel, making them super easy to slip on, and a textured outsole making them easy to run in. Hit the track, hit the trail, hit the treadmill — whatever you’re up for, these shoes are up for it too!</p><p>We’re not exaggerating when we say <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">these sneakers</a> come in a seriously impressive amount of colors. We’re talking over 50 options. You are practically guaranteed to find one that precisely fits your taste, if not dozens. And don’t forget, these running sneakers work perfectly for everyday life too, pairing with jeans or even a dress, so choose something you know will go with your favorite outfits!</p><p><strong>See it!
