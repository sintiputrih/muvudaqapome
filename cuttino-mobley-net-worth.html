As of mid-2016, it is reported by authoritative sources to be $24 million, acquired from his years as a professional basketball player.</p><h3>Cuttino Mobley Net Worth $24 million</h3><p>Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Mobley is the son of Jackie and Donald Mobley. He attended Incarnation of Our Lord grade school in his hometown and later finished high school at Maine Central Institute, matriculating in 1993. He got his degree in communication studies at the University of Rhode Island and this is where his fame for playing basketball started.</p><p>Mobley played basketball for the University for four years, and became known in the world of basketball for helping his team reach the Elite Eight in the 1998 National Collegiate Athletic Association, and the same year was drafted to the National Basketball League, the 41st pick of the team Houston Rockets. The beginning of his professional basketball career certainly increased his net worth.</p><p>During his years with Houston Rockets, Mobley became known for playing in the shooting guard position. The Rockets also became famous for Mobley’s team up with his best friend on the team<a href=#> Steve Francis</a>; together the two became monsters on the court, scoring non-stop, and in particular his three-pont shooting ranked him third in the NBL. In his first year, he earned the MBA All-Rookie second team honors in 1999. In 2004, he left the team and was traded to the Orlando Magic with Francis.</p><p>Mobley played for the Orlando Magic from 2004 to 2005, and was then traded to the Sacramento Kings for player Dour Christie, but the same year was transferred again, to Los Angeles Clippers where he spent his final years in the NBA until 2008. Although he experienced multiple transfers, his contracts still helped in maintaining his wealth.</p><p>In late 2008, Mobley was supposed to be transferred to the New York Knicks, but upon checking his health, the team discovered that he had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a disease in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, making it hard for the heart itself to pump blood. Because of the sensitivity of his condition, Mobley decided to end his career after 10 years of playing.</p><p>Today, although Mobley is not active in playing basketball anymore, he still does guest appearances in various leagues and matches.</p><p>In terms of his personal life, Mobley is married to Rochelle Mobley and together they have two children, Myles and Cuttino Jr.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=8.0980176211454><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Cuttino Mobley</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$24 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 1, 1975</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.93 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>98 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Basketball player</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Cardinal Dougherty High School, Maine Central Institute, University of Rhode Island</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Rochelle Mobley</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Myles Mobley, Cuttino Mobley, Jr.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Jackie Mobley, Donald Mobley</td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/cuttinoslife</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1932766/</a></td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>Has one son, Cuttino, Jr.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>2</td><td>Guard for Houston Rockets (1998-2004), Orlando Magic (2004-2005), Sacramento Kings (2005), and Los Angeles Clippers (2005-present).</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Diamond Life</td><td>2005</td><td>TV Series</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Cal Scruby ft.
