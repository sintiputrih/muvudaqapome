Once they hit adulthood, Molly and Jacob made it clear that reality TV wasn't for them. Jeremy and Audrey bowed out next, leaving <a href=#>Matt Roloff</a> and Caryn Chandler; Amy Roloff and Chris Marek; and Zach and Tori Roloff (and their kids) on the TLC series. But what about the OG Roloff couple — Matt's parents?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Matt Roloff's parents?</h2><p>Matt Roloff's parents are Peggy and Ron Roloff. They first appeared on Little People, Big World back in 2006 during Season 1 of the TLC series, and have occasionally traveled to Oregon to appear on the show or to simply visit off-camera — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including for pumpkin season at Roloff Farms</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Viewers experienced a bit of a Ron and Peggy hiatus on LPBW when Matt and Amy were in the middle of separating and then divorcing. This happened between Matt's parents' appearance in the Season 13 episode "New Year, Big Changes" in 2014 and a Season 18 episode titled "Four Generations of Roloffs" — during which Matt's parents traveled from California to Oregon to meet Zach and Tori's son, Jackson, on the first Father's Day after he was born.</p><p>"Six hundred miles is a short trip to make to see a great grandson," Ron said during the latter episode.</p><p>"Yup," Peggy agreed.</p><p>"I can't imagine being a great-grandfather. Are we old enough for that?" Ron playfully added.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Matt Roloff's father, Ron Roloff, died in 2022.</h2><p>Although Matt's mother Peggy is still alive today, unfortunately his father Ron died in 2022.</p><p>"A sad week for the Roloff Family. My dad, affectionately known as 'Papa' to his 10 grandchildren and his 10 great grandkids, peacefully went home to be with his Lord and Savior yesterday evening," Matt wrote in an Aug. 1 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a>.

I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. (John 14:2-3)."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>A celebration of life was held for Matt's father — and in November 2022, the LPBW star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared photos from the event with his Instagram</a> followers.
