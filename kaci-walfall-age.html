As the star of <a href=#>Naomi</a>, Kaci has made a name for herself as the titular DC Comics hero <a href=#>Naomi McDuffie</a>. Following a string of minor roles in various TV dramas, her role on the CW is easily her biggest gig yet as she makes a splash in the show's freshman run.</p><p>While Naomi certainly marks her big break, Kaci's acting career began for her as early as 8 years old. How old is the young actress now?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Kaci Walfall's age?</h2><p>Born on June 20, 2004, Kaci Walfall is currently 17 years old. On her birthday in 2021, Kaci took to Instagram to share a slideshow with photos of herself from the present as well as adorable snaps of her as a little kid. "Seventeen! This kid is doing alright!" she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">captioned the pics</a>.</p><p>By then, she certainly was doing alright! News about her starring role in Naomi had broken earlier that March and principal photography on Naomi <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began</a> two months later on Aug. 21.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Before landing the CW series, one of Kaci's earliest roles was Nyah, a minor recurring character in the final season of Army Wives in 2013. By then, she was about 8 or 9 years old. Along with a handful of other roles throughout her career, she also appeared in two episodes of 2021's <a href=#>The Equalizer</a>, a reboot series starring Queen Latifah. Her role in 2022's Naomi is her biggest break by far, and she's received great marks throughout the entire first season.</p><p>So far, Naomi has earned a 90 percent on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. The Critics Consensus name-dropped Kaci specifically, stating, "Kaci Walfall proves a plucky enough heroine to give the deliberately paced Naomi its own super-powered charm." Meanwhile, critics like Zaki Hasan from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">San Francisco Chronicle</a> called Kaci's work in Naomi "a winning performance."</p><p>The fact that she's managed to accomplish all of this before her 18th birthday is impressive, to say the least!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>As Naomi continues its freshman run, Kaci has received support from veterans from other live-action DC shows. In a joint interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a>, Kaci shared a conversation with <a href=#>Batwoman</a> star Javicia Leslie, who was the first Black actress to step into the role. As a trailblazing actor in DC shows, Javicia offered some self-care advice to Kaci as she continues achieving new heights.</p><p>"The most important thing that I found is to take time for yourself," Javicia advised Kaci. "Make sure that you take some time to breathe, meditate, pray if you're a praying person, or journal."</p><p>For a young up-and-coming actress, Kaci would do well to heed the advice of the Scarlet Knight.</p><p>New episodes of Naomi air Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on the CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoK6ktYywmKWekaG5bq3Gng%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
