It's understood that she removed the photo from the otherwise on-brand Instagram story a few hours later.&nbsp;</p><p>RHONY fans were quick to jump on the opportunity and managed to save the image before it was lost for eternity. It soon went viral, sparking a new conversation about Ramona's financial background — and her apparent reliance on her checking account.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'RHONY' star Ramona Singer posted a photo of her bank balance in March 2021.</h2><p>Ramona made the slip-up weeks before the <a href=#>premiere of Season 13 of RHONY</a> on May 4, 2021. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, she was quick to remedy the mistake and remove the photo only a few hours after it was posted — but fans turned out to be even quicker.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As the photo reveals, Ramona received $7,500 from Branded Entertainment Network, a Los Angeles-based product placement, influencer marketing, and licensing company, on Feb. 22, 2021. She also received $255.74 from Cameo, an app allowing fans to request personalized video messages from celebs. Ramona is thought to make $125 for each video. What's more, she also bagged $487.48 from Amazon Marketplace.&nbsp;</p><p>The screenshot garnered varied responses from fans.&nbsp;</p><p>"Thinking about the $376,764.61 sitting in Ramona Singer's checking account...," tweeted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@nikkipedia0</a>.</p><p>"I really hope she doesn’t keep that much in her checking account," tweeted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@macsongbirdd</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Ostensibly, the photo also spurred a makeshift conspiracy theory, with some claiming she might be involved in a money-laundering scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>"Y'all can hate on Ramona Singer all day long but Ramona isn't sharing her bank statement on Instagram if she's laundering money. Ramona is our likeable villain and I never want to lose her #RHONY #RHOSLC," tweeted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@morgan_letters</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ramona made a similar faux-pas with her bank balance in January 2021.</h2><p>Only a few months earlier, the celeb made the rounds by sharing an enigmatic screenshot of her Calculator app — which also happened to feature a five-digit number. It likely took slightly longer for fans to get to the bottom of the mystery and work out what exactly the 11,923 meant — but they cracked the code in the end.&nbsp;</p><p>"Her first real estate commission check," tweeted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@petem28</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"The Pinot Grigio budget clearly," tweeted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@__ericdiaz</a>.</p><p>"Surely not her bank balance?" tweeted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@satwindersehmi</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Ramona later on confirmed that the screenshot pertained to financial matters — and that she intended to forward it to her accountant before accidentally making it public knowledge via Instagram Stories.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The bank statement likely didn't convey the full magnitude of Ramona's net worth.</h2><p>As the screenshot of Ramona's bank statement revealed, the RHONY star generates some revenue from her Cameo videos, &nbsp;and from products sold on Amazon, including her 2015 book, Life on the Ramona Coaster. She also has a skincare line, Ageless by Ramona, her own wine line, Ramona Singer Pinot Grigio, among a range of other collaboration deals.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Ramona founded a company reselling excess inventory to discount stores, RMS Fashion, in January 1980. She also served as the co-founder of True Faith Jewelry. What's more, she likely made an impressive amount of money flipping houses as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to a rumor, she might get paid $500,000 per season for her work on RHONY. According to outlets like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CelebrityNetWorth</a>, her net worth in 2020 came to an estimated $18 million. Arguably, the photo of her bank account can be described as a scrap of the bigger picture.&nbsp;</p><p>Catch new episodes of RHONY every Tuesday at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp66uu82aZKyhnpyys3nBmqWkZZKWuaK6wp4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
