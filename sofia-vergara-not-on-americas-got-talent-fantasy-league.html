Here’s why the Modern Family&nbsp;actress is likely sitting this one out.&nbsp;</span></p><p>America’s Got Talent: Fantasy League is a spinoff of <a href=# rel=noopener>America’s Got Talent</a> that premiered on January 1, 2024. In this version, each judge will compete against each other by leading a team they drafted from across the AGT&nbsp;universe. Judges will mentor and guide the acts throughout the competition so that an act from their team will be crowned the AGT: Fantasy League champion. Terry Crews will return as host of the program.</p><p>During the&nbsp;AGT&nbsp;Season 18 finale, fans suggested acts they wanted to compete in&nbsp;Fantasy League. Forty of those acts advanced to the draft pool, and each of the judges selected 10 acts to join their dream team. The coveted <a href=# rel=noopener>Golden Buzzer</a> will continue to be used to send acts to the final round of the competition. Each judge can use their Golden Buzzer for their own act&nbsp;or to steal an act from a fellow judges’ team.</p><p>The America’s Got Talent: Fantasy League judges include Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum, Howie Mandel, and Mel B.&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Sofia Vergara will not be judging the spinoff</a>. Instead, the actress’ seat will be filled by English singer Mel B. Mel B previously judged Seasons 8 through 13 of AGT&nbsp;and Season 1 of&nbsp;AGT: The Champions, so she’s well familiar with the franchise.</p><p>“I did seven years and then in 2019, I came back to the U.K. because Spice Girls was going on tour, and I never went back. I set up home here with my kids and put them in school in my hometown, Leeds. So when I got asked to be back, it just so happened I had a break in my crazy, hectic schedule,” Mel B told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Glamour</a> of her return to&nbsp;AGT in December 2023. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, this is perfect timing.’”</p><p>So, why is Sofia Vergara not on America’s Got Talent Fantasy League?

Vergara was likely replaced in Fantasy League because she’s starring in the new Netflix show Griselda, which premiered on January 25, 2024. However, neither Vergara nor NBC has officially revealed the reason for her absence.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The Modern Family star is playing <span class="ILfuVd NA6bn UiGGAb" lang=en><span class=hgKElc>Griselda Blanco (known as the “Godmother of Cocaine”), an infamous Colombian</span></span><span class="ILfuVd NA6bn UiGGAb" lang=en><span class=hgKElc> drug lord who dominated the Miami underworld in the 1980s. </span></span></span>In an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>People </a>in November 2023, Vergara said she looked forward to the limited series and shared plans for a press tour in early 2024. “I start the world press tour right after New Year’s [Eve], so I’m ready for that. It’s going to be exciting,” she said.</p><p>Watch the official trailer for Netflix’s Griselda&nbsp;below.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>This marks the second time that Vergara will be missing from an AGT&nbsp;spinoff. In early 2023, she didn’t participate in America’s Got Talent: All-Stars alongside Cowell, Mandel, and Klum. While the actress didn’t reveal why she didn’t join her fellow judges last year, at the time, <a href=# rel=nofollow>she dropped her</a> latest collection of her Sofía Jeans by Sofía Vergara clothing line in U.S. Walmart stores and online.</p><p>As for whether Vergara will be involved in Season 19 of&nbsp;AGT next summer, you’re in luck! <a href=# rel=nofollow>NBC revealed</a> that all four judges (Mandel, Cowell, Klum, and Vergara) are “all set to sit in their usual seats, so barring some extraordinary circumstance, expect to see them.”</p><p>Vergara is estimated to be the second highest-paid judge on&nbsp;AGT behind creator Simon Cowell.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a> reported that Vergara earned $10 million per year as a judge when she joined the show in February 2020 for the fifth season, boosting her overall net worth to $180 million and earning her the title of the highest-paid actress in 2022.</p><p>America’s Got Talent:&nbsp;Fantasy League&nbsp;airs at 8 p.m. on Mondays on NBC.</p><p><strong>For more on&nbsp;America’s Got Talent, check out our gallery of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>America’s Got Talent salaries and find out which judge makes 30x more than their co-star</a></strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYWeDd4SOrKafoZFiw6a%2BxpqpmmWepMFuu81mmKadop6wor%2BMoKatZaSWuaa602admqaklsC6ecuemKCtlWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
