In Harrington’s post, the tubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff is brandishing a large ax as a Deadite bursts through the floor. Check out the post below to see the hilarious combination:</p><p>Funnily enough, if you were able to get <a href=#>Warner Bros Discovery</a> on board, you could make a Winnie the Pooh and Evil Dead crossover a reality. Pooh entered the public domain after being in Disney’s copyright clutches for nearly a century, meaning anyone who wants to use Pooh in their movie, show, or any other form of profitable media can use him unfettered by legal stipulations (sort of, as explained by <a href=#>IP Watchdog</a>). In other words, Harrington might be on to something here.</p><p>However, Harrington was beaten to the punch when it came to making a Winnie the Pooh horror film. Soon after Pooh entered the public domain, a horror film about him was made almost immediately. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey&nbsp;wasn’t nearly as good as any of the Evil Dead films, but it proves that combining Pooh and horror is an idea that more than a few people would like to see.</p><p>Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey&nbsp;was inspired by the classic A. A. Milne&nbsp;and&nbsp;E. H. Shepard books and featured Pooh and Piglet as bloodthirsty killers who go after a group of college co-eds and an adult Christopher Robin. The film was written, directed, and produced by Rhy Frake-Waterfield, who made the film on a shoestring budget of $100,000.&nbsp;However, the film was critically panned, so maybe Frake-Waterfield should consider an Evil Dead collaboration for future entries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/evil-dead-rise-trailer-demon-bath-900x506.jpg><p>Despite the abysmal <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=reviews data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>reviews</a>, Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey pulled in around $5.2 million at the global box office, making it an undeniably profitable film. This success encouraged Frake-Waterfield to begin work on a big-budget sequel. Reportedly, Frake-Waterfield said that he is also making horror movies in a shared continuity about Bambi and <a href=#>Peter Pan</a>, so maybe there’s hope for an Evil Dead crossover after all.</p><p>Weirdly enough, we’re living in a time where a Winnie the Pooh horror movie is being made while the Evil Dead franchise releases a brand-new movie. The recently released Evil Dead Rise hit theaters and follows two estranged sisters who must survive and save their family from Deadites. Unlike the Pooh movie, this film has received mostly positive reviews.</p><p>If you’re interested in checking out the sequel to Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, we can apparently expect to see it in early 2024. As far as Evil Dead Rises, you can catch that in theaters now. The film is doing well at the box office, and according to <a href=#>Bruce Campbell</a> we can expect to see more films from the franchise if this film ends up being successful — so make sure to see it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ivmaO7qrGMrZ%2BeZaCkvKl5xK%2BgpWWUmq6lesetpKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
