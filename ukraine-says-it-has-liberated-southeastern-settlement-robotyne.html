Anti-tank ditches and minefields stretch across the fields,” Solonko wrote.</p><p>“What is not dug up is mined. We need to go through all this to move forward,” he added.</p><p>Another major problem is Russian guided bombs, which Solonko described as a “formidable weapon,” which the enemy has been deploying on a massive scale.</p><p>To make matters worse, the bombed-out land where battles are being fought has left Ukrainian troops exposed and their movements visible from afar.</p><p>“The enemy has been preparing to meet you for a long time,” Solonko said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-style-default">Ukrainian forces raise the national flag in the settlement of Robotyne. <span class=credit>Valerii Zaluzhnyi via REUTERS</span></figure><p>The Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, commented in its latest update that “Ukrainian forces are now within striking distance of the next series of Russian defensive positions, which appears to be comprised of a relatively more contiguous array of anti-tank ditches and dragon’s teeth anti-tank obstacles, with Russian fighting positions behind these obstacles similar to the previous layer of Russian defenses.”</p><p>Ukrainian forces are also fighting Russian troops in the east, and progress in that sector has been slow because they have run into vast Russian minefields and trenches.</p><p>Maliar described the battlefield situation there as “very hot” in the past week.&nbsp;</p><p>She said Russian troops were amassing fresh forces there and regrouping.</p><p>Ukrainian forces had continued to advance south of the Russian-controlled city of Bakhmut in the east, retaking 0.4 square miles of territory.&nbsp;</p><p>With Post wires</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fma3BfqrizrcinnGarka7AbrXTZp%2Baq12htqOx0ZqrnpxdqLy2wMeemKyslae7br%2FEraulnZ2au7V50aiZqKypo7Jw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
