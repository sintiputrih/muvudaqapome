His mentor at “Wesleyan” recommended him to Stanford where he pursued his PhD in the early 1950s. His doctoral thesis was on “Achievement Anxiety.” After obtaining his PhD, he taught at Stanford for a year, and then he started to study “psychoanalysis” (theories and therapeutic techniques related to the study of the unconscious mind).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span><span style=color:purple>Physical Appearance</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Height (approx.):</strong> 6′ 3″</p><p><strong>Eye Colour:</strong> Vibrant Green</p><p><strong>Hair Colour:</strong> White</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ram-Dass-during-a-spiritual-session.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-36941 class=wp-caption-text>Ram Dass during a spiritual session</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family_Religion></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family_Religion></span><span style=color:purple>Family & Religion</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Richard Alpert was born into a <strong>Jewish Family</strong>.

David then helped Ram Dass get a tenured position at Harvard as an assistant clinical psychology professor. At Havard, he worked with the Social Relations Department, the Psychology Department, the Graduate School of Education, and the Health Service. He specialized in human motivation and personality development, and he published his first book when he was at Harvard titled “Identification and Child Rearing.”</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ram-Dass-when-he-was-in-Harvard-University.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-36935 class=wp-caption-text>Ram Dass (Richard Alpert) when he was at Harvard University</p><p>David’s close friend Timothy Leary also worked as a lecturer in clinical psychology at Harvard. Alpert (Ram Dass) became a deputy at Leary’s lab. In 1961, Alpert and Leary started doing research and experimentation with the potential therapeutic effects of hallucinogenic drugs such as “psilocybin,” “LSD-25,” and other “psychedelic chemicals” through their Harvard Psilocybin Project. In 1962, they assisted Walter Pahnke, a Harvard Divinity School student on his “Good Friday Experiment” (the first controlled, double-blind study of drugs and the mystical experience).</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ram-Dass-left-with-Timothy-Leary-centre-and-Walter-Pahnke-right.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-36938 class=wp-caption-text>Ram Dass (left) with Timothy Leary (centre) and Walter Pahnke (right)</p><p>In 1962, Dass and Leary co-founded the non-profit “International Federation for Internal Freedom” (IFIF) in Cambridge to carry out studies in the religious use of psychedelic drugs. In 1963, both of them were fired from Harvard. The Harvard President said Leary was dismissed for leaving Cambridge and his classes without permission or notice, and Alpert for allegedly giving psilocybin to an undergraduate.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ram-Dass-right-with-Timothy-Leary.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-36937 class=wp-caption-text>Ram Dass (right) with Timothy Leary</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Spiritual_Life></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Spiritual_Life></span><span style=color:purple>Spiritual Life</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 1967, Alpert (Ram Dass) visited India, and he got the opportunity to meet the American spiritual leader Bhagavan Das who made him meet the Indian guru “Neem Karoli Baba.” Karoli Baba had a huge impact on Alpert’s mind, and he became Karoli’s disciple. Alpert used to call Karoli Baba “Maharaj-Ji,” and he was given the name “Ram Dass” (Servant of God) by Karoli Baba. Once, in an interview, he said that he gave Baba Karoli a big amount of LSD, but it did not affect him at all, his mind was at a greater high with his connection to God and the LSD was no match for that.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ram-Dass-with-Neem-Karoli-Baba.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-36968 class=wp-caption-text>Ram Dass with Neem Karoli Baba</p><p>Ram Dass returned to America soon and started giving lectures on spiritual guidance and guiding people according to what Karoli Baba had taught him. In 1971, he wrote a book titled “Be Here Now,” which went on to become the best seller and sold more than 5 million copies. In 1974, Ram Dass had created the “Hanuman Foundation,” a non-profit foundation which was meant to embody the spirit of service inspired his Guru.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ram-Dass-book-Be-Here-Now.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-36972 class=wp-caption-text>Ram Dass’ book- Be Here Now</p><p>In 1986, Dass, along with Dale Borglum, created “The Living/Dying Project” based in Marin County, California and located in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was the first residential facility in the United States where people came to “die consciously.”</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ram-Dass-at-the-Dying-Project-in-Santa-Fe.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-36973 class=wp-caption-text>Ram Dass at the Dying Project in Santa Fe</p><p>In August 1991, he received the “Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award.” Ram Dass, who had been an Athiest all his life, started exploring “Judaism” for the first time when he turned sixty years old. Once, in an interview, he said-</p><p>My belief is that I wasn’t born into Judaism by accident, and so I needed to find ways to honour that. “From a Hindu perspective, you are born as what you need to deal with, and if you just try and push it away, whatever it is, it’s got you”</p><p>In February 1997, he had suffered a stroke which left him with “expressive aphasia” and paralyzed him. He was not able to speak and many parts of his body were not able to move, hence putting him in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. However, he found a way to speak partially and he started giving his lectures and teachings online. In 2004, he moved to Maui, Hawaii and lived there permanently. On 22 December 2019, he died at his house in Maui at the age of 88. His death was announced on his Instagram page and the cause of death is unknown.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ram-Dass-1.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=FactsTrivia></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=FactsTrivia></span><span style=color:purple>Facts/Trivia</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>His book “Be Here Now” was a bestseller and it had inspired people like “Steve Jobs,” “George Harrison” of The Beatles, and “Mark Zuckerberg.”</li></ul><ul><li>His book and teachings also had a life-changing effect on many factions of society.
