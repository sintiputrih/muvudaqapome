The nuptials came amid turmoil in the police officer’s personal life stemming from past relationships.</p><p>Before the country singer’s wedding to McLoughlin, she was married to <a href=#><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a> from May 2011 to July 2015. News of his ex-wife’s second marriage came as a shock to the&nbsp;<a href=#>Voice</a>&nbsp;coach. “Blake <a href=#>found [out] about the wedding</a> at the same time as everyone else did,” a source told&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;in February 2019, shortly after Lambert announced her new relationship status.</p><p>Shelton, who has since moved on with <a href=#><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong></a>, mentioned to the No Doubt singer that “the timing of Miranda’s announcement of the marriage was certainly curious,” according to an insider. However, “just because Miranda got married in a quickie situation <a href=#>doesn’t change anything for Gwen and Blake</a>.”</p><p>McLoughlin has a complicated past too. The New York City police officer <a href=#>got another woman pregnant while cheating on his fiancée</a>, <strong>Jackie Bruno</strong>, his ex’s mother, Carol Bruno, claimed in February 2019. “[Brendan] tried to deny it and then begged her to stay with him,” she told&nbsp;Us&nbsp;at the time. “She was only going [abroad] for a few months to play [soccer], he was begging her to marry him before she left, even though he knew the girl was pregnant.”</p><p>McLoughlin welcomed a son with <strong>Kaihla Rettinger</strong> in November 2018, <a href=#>days after he met Lambert</a> for the first time.</p><p>The Grammy winner previously made headlines for getting close to musician <strong>Evan Felker</strong> while she was still in a relationship with <strong>Anderson East</strong>. Two weeks <a href=#>after Lambert split from East</a> in April 2018, Us confirmed that <a href=#>she had moved on with Felker</a>, who was still married to <strong>Staci Felker</strong> at the time. The duo divorced in August 2018 <a href=#>but later reconciled, welcoming their first child</a> in 2021.</p><p>Lambert has a history of moving fast in relationships, but she explained that her pace with McLoughlin was actually beneficial for the duo.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We didn’t date very long before we got married. And so we sort of got to just really, really, really get to know each other,” she said during a SiriusXM interview in February 2021. “It was just us two with no distraction, at my farm outside of Nashville. And so I was really thankful for it because it made us really strong.”</p><p>Scroll to relive Lambert and McLoughlin’s hasty romance, from cheating allegations to a quickie wedding.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqq%2BwKebmmWclrqjsdGtZJuqlaOxorqMppqlp6Wcta21zWaroqWVobavsYyonWasmJq2s3nRqKSappOafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
