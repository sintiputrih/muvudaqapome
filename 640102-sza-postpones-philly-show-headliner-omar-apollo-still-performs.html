The Grammy Award winner was set to perform in Philidelphia on Thursday (March 2) but unexpectedly postponed the show the morning of. SZA, who just accepted the 2023 Woman of the Year award at the Billboard Women In Music event the night prior, was expected to travel from Los Angeles for her Thursday performance. Although the reason for cancellation is uncertain, it is likely due to issues that occurred on her cross-country trip.</p><p>The show was supposed to be held at the Wells Fargo Center in Philly. The venue took to Twitter Thursday morning to announce the abrupt change in plans. "The SZA performance scheduled for today at Wells Fargo Center is postponed," the tweet read, "fans are encouraged to hold onto their tickets for the rescheduled date to be announced shortly. All tickets will be honored." The 33-year-old singer also took to the platform to issue her own apology, writing "Phillyyyy I REALLY wanted to see you tonight but due to unforeseen logistical/ production issues weâ€™re FORCED to reschedule."</p><span><h2 id=h-despite-sza-s-cancellation-the-show-goes-on>Despite SZA's Cancellation, The Show Goes On</h2></span><p>Opening for SZA during the SOS Tour is 25-year-old singer Omar Apollo. Fusing together R&B and pop, Apollo especially gained recognition in hip-hop for his track "Evergreen." The song was included on his debut studio album, Ivory, which dropped in April 2022. Additionally, the artist earned recognition last month for receiving his first Grammy nomination. Needless to say, Apollo achieved a successful year of career growth, similar to SZA's gains with <a href=# rel>her sophomore album.</a></p><p>Although the tour's Philly performance has been canceled, Apollo has found a way to make the show go on. He announced a "secret show" in New York City, which would replace the original set that would have been happening just a few hours away. Immediately, his impromptu concert, which was set at Irving Plaza, sold out of tickets. But, fans are still awaiting the new dates for SZA's Philly show. As of now, she is set to perform a two-night run at Madison Square Garden on March 4th and 5th.
