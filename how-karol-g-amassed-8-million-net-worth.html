The reggaeton artist had a hard time getting labels to take her seriously at first, and it was a slow and difficult climb to the place she is today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately, with a handful of collaborations with both industry staple Nicky Jam and then-up-and-coming names Ozuna, Karol finally made it on a global scale.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Ozuna Amassed His $15 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>A spot on a TV show, more collabs (this time with artists like Bad Bunny and J Balvin), and some business smarts led Karol G to begin amassing both a long list of hit songs and an impressive net worth to show for it.</p><p>Her net worth may <a href=#>currently be half of Bad Bunny's</a>, but Karol is well on her way to bulking up to compete with her co-collaborator. Here's how she's made her $8M, and where she's going next.</p><h2 id=who-is-the-reggaeton-artist-karol-g>Who Is The Reggaeton Artist Karol G?</h2><p>She's a minority of a minority, as a Colombian woman who mostly fits into the reggaeton genre, but Carolina Giraldo Navarro definitely carved out a place for herself (and her music). She's been grinding for decades already, but it wasn't until 2017 that she really earned mainstream attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Daddy Yankee Came Up With His Stage Name</a></span></p><p>After almost a full decade of working her way up, Karol G collaborated with Bad Bunny on "Ahora Me Llama," and the rest is really history. Millions of YouTube hits later, Karol G is on her third album and shows no signs of letting up.</p><h2 id=what-is-karol-g-39-s-net-worth>What Is Karol G's Net Worth?</h2><p>Most sources agree that Karol G is worth an impressive $8 million, and considering that she didn't really start building her income until about 2017, that's an insane amount of cash. But how exactly did she earn it?</p><p>In an unsurprising twist, Karol G pretty much made most of her cash through her music. The thing is, everyone knows album sales don't always amount to much. Fortunately for Karol, she's had multiple singles go platinum-certified, and that means plenty of fans want to stream her tracks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, even in 2018 (when she'd only released a single album), Karol G already had 14 million monthly listeners on Spotify. Her songs had been streamed more than 119 million times, and that was before Karol won a bunch of music awards and put out her second and third albums.</p><p>Clearly, 'Ocean' and 'KG0516' also added to Karol's pocketbook, especially the latter, as it's her newest release and is more star-studded than ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's also the fact that artists can earn from YouTube, and with millions of views on her music videos (and her appearance in others' vids), it's likely that Karol's getting a cut of that cash.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-karol-g-get-paid>How Much Does Karol G Get Paid?</h2><p>It's likely that she's earning more this year than in any previous year (more on that later), but Karol G stands to earn somewhere around $480K per year, <a href=#>sources suggest</a>.</p><p>Yet it's difficult to pinpoint specific numbers, especially because Karol apparently only made a few grand per month, all the way until mid-2017 when her music began to gain more [lucrative] traction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Projections suggest Karol may very well be raking in $50K to $140K per month throughout 2021. Clearly, there's a significant margin for error, but it's not a shocking figure by any means. After all, she's already built a net worth of $8M, and the only way to go now is up.</p><h2 id=how-is-karol-making-money-now>How Is Karol Making Money Now?</h2><p>Now that she's put out some hot albums that climbed the charts and padded her pockets, how is Karol G making her money? She's not sitting around collecting royalties. In fact, she's planning to go on tour in 2021 with her newest album.</p><h2 id=did-karol-g-and-anuel-break-up>Did Karol G And Anuel Break Up?</h2><p>Fans were thrilled when Karol G announced she and one of her co-collaborators, Anuel AA, were dating. They met a month after Anuel AA got out of prison, and subsequently worked on a song together, but fans were willing to look past his potentially checkered past (he seemed to make Karol super happy).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Shawn Mendes And Camila Cabello Have Been Together For Two Years: Hereâ€™s An Update</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They even pulled a Camila Cabello-Shawn Mendes move and had an onstage smooch before revealing they were together. What intrigue, right?!</p><p>But although Karol showed up to the 2019 Latin Music Awards rocking a diamond on her ring finger, the two only remained engaged for about a year before splitting up. That didn't stop anyone and everyone from speculating about their future combined net worth though.</p><h2 id=what-is-anuel-aa-39-s-net-worth>What Is Anuel AA's Net Worth?</h2><p>It's tougher to pin down Anuel AA's net worth since he's somewhat of a lesser star than Karol G, at least in terms of mainstream reception. Still, sources peg him at a worth of around $20M, which is definitely nothing to scoff at.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>J Balvin Is Worth $16 Million: Here's How The Reggaeton Singer Got So Rich</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9doK6zu8tmnmaZnZbAtLHDZm9mpZmhuaq7zWalnqxdrLyzwMdo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
