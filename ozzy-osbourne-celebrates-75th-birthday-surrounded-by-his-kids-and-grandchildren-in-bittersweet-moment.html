Reflecting on his music career, he expressed frustration at not being able to properly bid farewell or show gratitude to his fans. “That’s one of the things I’ve been the most f–king pissed off at: I never got the chance to say goodbye or thank you,” he lamented.</p><p id=efQk6J94mOz data-wc=43>Still, Ozzy harbors the hope of performing once again, though he insists he won't settle for a "half-hearted" show or perform in a wheelchair.
