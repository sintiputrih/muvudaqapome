Mmm, delish!</p><p><h3>Check out Mindy Kaling's sandwich!</h3></p><p><h3>Jessica Alba's plates look almost too good mess up by, you know, eating what's assembled on them. She's also a notorious food pic poster.</h3></p><h3>That munchaholic known as&nbsp;<a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a>'s breakfast consisted of fruit.</h3><p><h3>Street food caught Mindy Kaling's eye.</h3></p><h3><a href=#>Jessie J</a>'s healthy, fish-centric meal. It's mackerel and the British singer fueled up.</h3><p><h3>Miss Jessie J also posted a snap of her delicious, leafy green salad, consumed during a break in the studio. Her food pic posts are the best. We know, we see them every day! She is a healthy eater. This pic is so rich and green that it makes us want to head to the nearest SaladWorks.</h3></p><p><h3>J. Alba and her daughters enjoyed lunch truck eats by mom's Honest Company offices. Honor and Haven are ADORBS!</h3></p><p><h3>That was some beefy burger for Kevin McHale to consume on Easter Sunday. That thing is bigger than our heads.</h3></p><p><h3>Mimi sipped (what looks like) some champagne on Easter Sunday. A diva's got to have her fave beverage. We don't really envision her sipping apple juice.</h3></p><p><h3>Buffet-style is also good, as Kevin McHale demonstrated.</h3></p><h3><a href=#>Gavin DeGraw</a> noshed on Easter donuts. Sunday is a good cheat day, even on Easter, where you should be allowed to eat all the junk you want.</h3><h3>Mega pregnant&nbsp;<a href=#>Ciara</a> indulged her cravings and had some butter pecan ice cream. The singer is eating for two, so let her have at it!</h3><p><h3>Emmy Rossum is allergic to gluten, but that didn't stop her from bagel sniffing and indulging without eating. She had to indulge her senses somehow, right?</h3></p><p><h3>Another Jessie J food snap. She enjoyed some healthy AM eats. Coconut water is faboosh!</h3></p><h3><a href=#>Lance Bass</a> raised a glass of mead at Medieval Times. It's like 'Cable Guy' all over again. Who doesn't love food-as-entertainment?</h3><h3>That's an apple that <a href=#>Hilary Duff</a> was in the middle of, while watching 'Blacklist.'</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6Wws8HSoWWcp51ksKa4xJuqZp2Rqbavs4yjnKyrmZiubq3Lm5hmpZGntqK0jJyYq52pYrOwu8Nmp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
