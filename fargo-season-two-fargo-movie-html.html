In the series, Rye enters into a deal with a typewriter salesman (Mike Bradecich), whose mannerisms echo Jerry’s. He is confident that this latest typewriter model will allow them to “turn on the money spigot.” Of course, this is<i> Fargo</i>, and both ventures result in dead bodies.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1ec14caa0d70f4026861a684d53ed58f-11-0-0@published data-word-count=108><b>A murder begins with one main target, then ropes in two innocent bystanders.</b> The first murder in <i>Fargo</i> the film occurs when an unlucky police officer pulls Carl and Gaear over. While Carl is moving the body, two people happen to drive by and bear witness, forcing Gaear to chase them down and add them to the body count. In the series, Rye — high on cocaine — pulls a gun on the judge and shoots her dead. However, he also seems to have forgotten that he committed the crime in full view of the Waffle Hut’s cook and waitress, forcing him to take their lives as well.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1ec14caa0d70f4026861a684d53ed58f-12-0-0@published data-word-count=22><strong>Criminals love breakfast.</strong> Rye commits his murders at the Waffle Hut, which could be analogous to the film’s unseen, much-lauded “pancakes house.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1ec14caa0d70f4026861a684d53ed58f-14-0-0@published data-word-count=5><br><strong>Episode 2: “Before the Law”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1ec14caa0d70f4026861a684d53ed58f-15-0-0@published data-word-count=38><b>A salesman deals with creditors.</b> Before Mike and his hit men accomplices put some pressure on Skip, the typewriter salesman, he can be heard on the phone with his creditors, mirroring a similar scene in the original film.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1ec14caa0d70f4026861a684d53ed58f-17-0-0@published data-word-count=34><b>Ed Blumquist grinds up his victim.</b> This one’s pretty obvious, right?

In one scene, Steve Buscemi takes an escort out to see Feliciano, who performs the song. (I’m about 99.9 percent sure that the version used in the show is a cover by Jeff Tweedy, but I can’t find any record of such a song existing.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1ec14caa0d70f4026861a684d53ed58f-29-0-0@published data-word-count=3><b>Episode 8: “Loplop”</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1ec14caa0d70f4026861a684d53ed58f-30-0-0@published data-word-count=54>This episode is an extended riff on the cabin sequester in the film, when Carl and Grimsrud take Jerry’s wife up to the cabin and leave her tied up there.
