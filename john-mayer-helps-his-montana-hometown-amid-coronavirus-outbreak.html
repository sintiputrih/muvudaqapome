Shortly after relocating to his Montana ranch, the “Heartbreak Warfare” crooner <a href=#>admitted to CBS News</a> that his new rural life gave him a certain freedom.</p><p>“It’s very <a href=#>liberating</a> when you finally realize that it’s impossible to make everyone like you,” Mayer said at the time, explaining the differences between life in the city and in the country. “I wanted everybody to like me.”</p><p>Generosity has become contagious among the Hollywood community as the world continues to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus. Stars like <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Selena Gomez</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong></a> have all used their platforms to help communities and individuals who are struggling to make ends meet amid the pandemic.</p><p>“I think we can all agree, COVID-19 is an a–hole,” the Deadpool actor, 43, tweeted in March. “<a href=#><strong>Blake [Lively]</strong></a> and I are <a href=#>donating $1 million</a> to be split between Feeding America and Food Banks Canada. If you can give, these orgs need our help.”</p><p>The Gossip Girl alum, 32, echoed her husband’s statement at the time, adding some words of encouragement to those who might be feeling lonely or anxious about the practice of social distancing.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Though <a href=#>we must be distancing ourselves</a> to protect those who don’t have the opportunity to self-quarantine, we can stay connected,” Lively wrote. “Remember the lonely and isolated. Facetime, Skype, make a video. Remember the love that can travel through all this.”</p><p>Given the constantly evolving nature of COVID-19,&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;wants our readers to have access to the most accurate resources.
