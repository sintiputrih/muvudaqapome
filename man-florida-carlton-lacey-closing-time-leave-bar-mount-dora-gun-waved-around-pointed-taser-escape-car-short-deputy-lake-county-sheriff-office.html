(TND) — </span>All good times must come to an end, and apparently that's what caused trouble in a bar in Florida, early Sunday, May 12.</p>“A short [man] with a long beard threatened her with a gun,” a bartender told authorities, according to the arrest report.A deputy arrived and found “a short [man] who matched the provided description outside in the parking lot of the establishment.<p>“I approached the male and tried to talk to him.</p>“The male had his hands in his pockets so I gave him verbal commands to remove his hands, as I removed my agency-issued handgun from the holster.“The male put his hands in the air and started to walk away from me.“I verbally told the male to stop, and he then turned away from me and started running.”<p>That led to a short chase around a nearby building but the suspect got away.</p><p>The deputy wrote, “I asked the bystanders what direction the suspect went in. I received several different locations.”</p><p>Other officers went to search while the deputy spoke to two victims who “were threatened by the suspect.</p>“[One said] she was behind the bar, telling patrons to exit the building because it was time to close.“She stated that the suspect, who was later identified as Carlton Lacey, Jr., pulled a gun from his waistband and said ‘Who needs to leave?’ as he waved the gun in the air in her direction.<p>“[She said] that Mr. Lacey then returned his gun to his waistband.</p>“After concealing the gun, [the other victim] told Mr. Lacey to leave, as well, in which he responded by taking the gun out again and pointing it at [this victim’s] chest.“[She said] Mr. Lacey made physical contact with her by putting the nozzle of the gun into her chest.“She also advised that Mr. Lacey stated, ‘keep playing with me b____’ as he pointed the gun at her.<p>“Both victims described the gun as a black in color pistol, and they were in fear of Mr. Lacey.”</p><p>The suspect may have been on the loose, but the victims were able to provide his license plate number.</p><p>Finally, “Additional units were able to locate the vehicle not too far from the scene,” and there were three men inside.</p>Another deputy conducted a traffic stop “and ended up tasering one of the males in the vehicle.“The male that was tased matched the description of the male that ran from me.”<p>The two victims pointed Lacey out, mentioning his height difference “in comparison to the other males in the showup.</p>“Mr. Lacey is approximately 5 foot 3 inches, and the other two males were closer to 6 foot tall.”<p>One thing they never got was the gun. The deputy wrote about searching the car, as well as “the area where Mr. Lacey ran from me. Mr. Lacey declined ever having a weapon or threatening the two victims. While on scene, multiple bystanders said he had a gun and waved it around, inside and outside the establishment.”</p><p>Lacey’s arrest report from 2001 mentioned “four prior felony convictions.”</p><p>In 2008, he pleaded no contest to cocaine possession, resisting with violence, burglary, and possession of burglary tools, and he spent a year-and-a-half in state prison.</p><p>This time, Lacey, 39, was charged with two counts of aggravated assault, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and resisting without violence.</p><p>His bail was set at $21,000 and he has not paid it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmpawtcKNnKamZ56axLR7zZqroqeeYsSwvsudZqaZnmKzrbvRopuaZZOWv63AzqdkpZmTmsZur8uoqqKml2LBqrnEZqOemaaaeqOt0WakqK2eqXqlu9GaZKCtnmLEosLEnWSaqp%2Bqu6V5z6igp6yVmXq1rdKeqWado5iusbGMnJirZaOdvLPAjJ2cqa2krnqtrcqeZJynpaPBunnSoZyroZaberCyxaKang%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
