All in all, it might be best to give up on whatever dreams remain, and instead refresh our fan-casting chops with another candidate whose greatest strength may also be his greatest weakness.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true><a href=#>How would folks feel about Miles Teller at this point?</a> from <a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Miles Teller</a></strong>, known for his roles in Whiplash and Top Gun: Maverick, boasts the curious distinction of having already played Reed Richards in a film, which one might think would give him an edge on the competition. Unfortunately, that role was in 2015’s Fantastic Four reboot, a movie that made us all wish Wanda killed us instead of the Illuminati.</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>Some responders vouched for Teller’s return, but others weren’t convinced that Feige would ever risk reminding us about that particular Fantastic Four movie.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>TheIncredibleDjango’s comment from discussion "How would folks feel about Miles Teller at this point?"</a>.</figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Zelkeh’s comment from discussion "How would folks feel about Miles Teller at this point?"</a>.</figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>lanwopc’s comment from discussion "How would folks feel about Miles Teller at this point?"</a>.</figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>knotsteve’s comment from discussion "How would folks feel about Miles Teller at this point?"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>One other user suggested that Teller would make a better Maker than Mister Fantastic, especially considering how Teller’s Fantastic Four movie was a loose adaptation of Ultimate Fantastic Four, the comic run in which the Maker version of Richards made his debut. Moreover, if Feige were to ever remind us about that film, it would be best for it to be in the form of a villain that we cheer against.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>MarvelousJoe’s comment from discussion "How would folks feel about Miles Teller at this point?"</a>.</figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>itunesdentist’s comment from discussion "How would folks feel about Miles Teller at this point?"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Knowing Marvel, it’s safe to assume that most all fan-casting theories won’t be coming to fruition, and we’ll be getting a face out of left field once the MCU brings its version of the Four to the big screen. But, the fun of dreaming isn’t getting it right; it’s getting to set your imagination loose like the comic books have done for so many decades.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8mon6dlm6eutLXNrKKiZZmoerG%2BzpuYm6SpYry2wIyspmaekaPAbr%2FTmqueZaSdsm6vwKycZp6fp3qius6tn56qXaeyprCMq6CcoJGnsbR5xZqlZpuRqMFutc2sq56ZlGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
