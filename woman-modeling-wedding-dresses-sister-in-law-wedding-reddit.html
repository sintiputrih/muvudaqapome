"My brother, Simon, got married last week but they postponed their honeymoon because of his job. So when the advert came out yesterday, my sister-in-law Nancy saw it in the shopping center. She called me and asked why I have bridal photos in the city center and I told her I got an offer to model bridal gowns for this boutique."</p><p>Thinking she didn't do anything wrong, she asked Nancy "what she thought" of the photos. She didn't get the response she was hoping for.</p><p>"Honestly, I was expecting feedback like 'you looked beautiful' or 'the gowns looked good on you', but <a href=#>instead she yelled at me on the phone</a> and accused me of being jealous of her," she continued. "I was surprised because Nancy and I are friendly with each other, I didn’t expect her to blow up on me like that. She hung up on me and a few minutes later I got a call from her sister, who sounded really upset with me for stealing her sister’s thunder."</p><p>The woman stood up for herself.</p><p>"I told her Nancy’s wedding was literally 7 days ago, so why are they accusing me of stealing her thunder? We got into a verbal altercation, she called me names, and I retaliated and called her names before I hung up," she said, adding her sister-in-law's family has been leaving negative comments on her modeling photos after she posted them on social media.</p><p>"Last night I saw a <a href=#>TikTok</a> video about the whole situation and a lot of Nancy’s friends are siding with her, they said I was jealous of the bride that’s why I did the photo shoot. They’re also commenting nasty things on my Instagram, so I had to turn the comment section off," she wrote.</p><p>Meanwhile, her brother refuses to address it: "I asked Simon to talk to his wife but he wants nothing to do with it."</p><p>In the comments, users mostly sided with the woman, claiming she was simply "doing her job" and that her sister-in-law is overreacting.</p><p>"I don't understand what's wrong with those people. She had her day, you are doing your job. This sounds like people in their teens," one person wrote.</p><p>"You were working and even if you weren't, how long is anything bridal banned for because of her wedding? She, her sister and her friends are ridiculous," another user commented.</p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Celebrity Family Feuds</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6Wws8HSoWWcp51kxLC5wKdkpqeUmrmqusZmrp6clJ67qHnDq5ysq5WoerS10q2cq2WZo3qtrdZmrp6clJ67qHnRnpudoaRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
