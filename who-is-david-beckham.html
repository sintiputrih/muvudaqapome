Long before Manchester City dominated English soccer, David Beckham was part of an all-conquering Man Utd team.</p><p>When only a few games were live on TV, long before soccer fans could make predictions at the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">top Alabama sports betting apps</a>, Becks was the sport’s most famous and best-loved player, recognized wherever you went.</p><p>Beckham’s professional soccer career began in 1992 when the young player broke through the ranks at Manchester United. Following a glittering youth career for the Red Devils, winning several major honors, the attacker spent a short period at Preston North End on loan.</p><p>The idea was to give a young Beckham, still wet behind the ears, the vital experience of playing at senior level, competing against adults fighting hard for a win bonus.</p><p>It was about as far removed from his glory years at United and Real Madrid, but it was necessary for his development. Back in the red of Man Utd and playing at the Theatre of Dreams regularly alongside fellow graduate academy stars like Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, Beckham used the lessons learned at Preston to launch his career. He debuted in 1995 in a Premier League game against Leeds United.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Slow_start_for_a_future_star></span><strong>Slow start for a future star</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It was a quiet opening campaign for Becks, who played just four times that season as his employers finished second behind Blackburn Rovers. But the winds of change were blowing through Old Trafford, and following a rare trophyless season, Sir Alex Ferguson gave youth a chance.</p><p>The Scotsman famously said, “If you’re good enough, you’re old enough. Fergie gave several of United’s top names their big break.&nbsp;</p><p>It was the start of a career that would take Beckham to the dizzy heights of soccer, winning several respected titles in Europe and further afield.</p><p>Some of Becks’ achievements include winning the Premier League, FA Cup, Champions League, La Liga, MLS Cup, Ligue 1 title, and FIFA World Player of the Year. He saw it all, won it all, and bought the t-shirt&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">representing clubs like Man Utd</a>, Real Madrid, PSG, AC Milan, and LA Galaxy.</p><p>On the soccer pitch, Beckham was a serial winner. From his youth career to his retirement from the game in 2013, Beckham set the bar, dominating a star-studded period of professional soccer.</p><p>And he carried that winning attitude into life, making a success of everything he’s done, including retirement. While many former soccer players and sports stars struggle when it’s time for their careers to end, it was just the start for David.</p><p>He has succeeded in many areas since hanging up the boots, including fashion, TV, business, and family life.
