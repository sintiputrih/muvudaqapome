The Raiders were 1st in 2min scoring points and only gave up 2 sacks. The line only gave up 12 out of the 25 sacks in 2011.</p><p>The offensive line received the Madden Protectors Award in Week 6 for their performance against the Cleveland Browns and rookie guard Stefen Wisniewski was named to the PFW All-Rookie Team.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-913 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 large-leaderboard-2 large-leaderboard-2913 adtester-container adtester-container-913" data-ez-name=informationcradle_com-large-leaderboard-2><span id=div-gpt-ad-informationcradle_com-large-leaderboard-2-0 style=position:relative;z-index:0;padding:0;position:sticky!important;top:0!important;min-height:100px;min-width:320px class="ezoic-ad ezads-sticky-intradiv ezoic-adl"></span></span><span style=height:14px;margin:auto;position:relative class=reportline><span style=text-align:center;font-size:12px!important;font-family:arial!important;float:right;line-height:normal class=ezoicwhat></span></span></p><p>They also paved the way for RB Michael Bush to rush for 977 yards and seven touchdowns.

Wylie joined the Zach Gelb Show on CBS Radio and had many critical things to say about the new Browns coach, who opted to not retain Wylie.</p><p>After some pleasantries about Wylie’s famous Hard Knocks appearances last summer, the tone of the conversation turned darker.

Thanks for helping me get the interview, okay? but I’m going to take this job and you guys are going to become collateral damage, that’s what will happen,”’</p><p>The veteran line coach had an expressed chagrin that the Browns seem to have much interest in keeping interim head coach Gregg Williams instead of going with Kitchens. The change among the offensive staff clearly bothered Wylie, and he took a shot at how little Kitchens actually coached.</p><p>“Kenny Zampese did all the coaching there. Baker likes Freddie, so that had to (inaudible) into the decision (to hire Kitchens).” “Al Saunders did the red zone. I did all the protections.”</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 large-mobile-banner-1 large-mobile-banner-1916 adtester-container adtester-container-916" data-ez-name=informationcradle_com-large-mobile-banner-1><span id=div-gpt-ad-informationcradle_com-large-mobile-banner-1-0 style=position:relative;z-index:0;padding:0;position:sticky!important;top:0!important;min-height:600px;min-width:300px class="ezoic-ad ezads-sticky-intradiv ezoic-adl"></span></span><span style=height:14px;margin:auto;position:relative class=reportline><span style=text-align:center;font-size:12px!important;font-family:arial!important;float:right;line-height:normal class=ezoicwhat></span></span></p><p>Zampese and Saunders came to Cleveland with Hue Jackson after coaching with him in either Cincinnati or Oakland. The circumstances of his firing bothered Wylie, too.</p><p>“My daughter called me and said, ‘Hey, dad, you just got fired today,’’ Wylie said. “That’s the first time I head about it. I was laying in a hospital bed they packed up my office and they put my office in storage because I was still in the hospital.”</p><p>Wylie had to step away from the team after suffering a nasty leg injury.

But that’s not the only change being made to the coaching staff.</p><p>Offensive line coach Bob Wylie is among the assistant coaches who have been let go amid the change in leadership. Wylie, of course, became a viral sensation for his “set hut” calls featured on Hard Knocks last year.</p><p>This is just the latest tough break for the 67-year-old. Wylie suffered a broken ankle during a Dec. 20 practice. Wylie held a number of different roles between the college and professional ranks over the past four decades. He joined the Browns’ coaching staff back in January 2017.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bob-wylie-blasted-by-former-browns-coach></span>Bob Wylie Blasted by Former Browns&nbsp;Coach<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bob Wylie has been making the media rounds talking about his former team.

One of the biggest claims Wylie made was that&nbsp;quarterbacks coach Kenny Zampese&nbsp;was responsible for the team’s strong 5-3 finish, not Kitchens.</p><p>“Baker (Mayfield) likes Freddie,’’ Wylie said. “There’s a good relationship there even though (former Browns QB coach) Kenny Zampese did all the coaching there. Baker likes Freddie, so that had to (factor) into the decision.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span></p><p class=article__paragraph>“(But) Freddie didn’t have any coordinator experience or head coaching experience.” He also noted that he was surprised interim head coach Gregg Williams wasn’t considered more strongly for the position.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_20"></span></p><p>“That shocked me because Gregg Williams turned the team around. In the second half of the season, that’s his work that got it to where it is. My own personal feeling is Gregg was too strong a candidate for the seat,’’ Wylie said.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-919 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 mobile-leaderboard-1 mobile-leaderboard-1919 adtester-container adtester-container-919" data-ez-name=informationcradle_com-mobile-leaderboard-1><span id=div-gpt-ad-informationcradle_com-mobile-leaderboard-1-0 style=position:relative;z-index:0;padding:0;position:sticky!important;top:0!important;min-height:100px;min-width:320px class="ezoic-ad ezads-sticky-intradiv ezoic-adl"></span></span><span style=height:14px;margin:auto;position:relative class=reportline><span style=text-align:center;font-size:12px!important;font-family:arial!important;float:right;line-height:normal class=ezoicwhat></span></span></p><p>“I don’t think Dorsey wanted to go head-to-head with Gregg like he had to do with Andy Reid in Kansas City, so he kind of filtered Gregg out of the picture and he kept the search going.”</p><p>Wiley’s resume in football extends back nearly four decades but he did not survive the coaching turnover this offseason when Kitchens took over. There’s a good chance many of these new comments surfacings can likely be traced back to that.</p><p class=article__paragraph>“(It was like) ‘thank you guys, you guys did a great job. Thanks for helping me get the interview, okay? But I’m going to take this job and you guys are going to become collateral damage, that’s what will happen,’” Wylie said.
