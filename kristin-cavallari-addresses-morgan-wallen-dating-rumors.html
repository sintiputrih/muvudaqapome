Cavallari responded, “I’m not dating him!”</p><p>In <a href=#>Us Weekly’s recent cover story</a>, Cavallari dished that her three kids — <a href=#>Camden,10, Jaxon, 8, and Saylor, 7</a> — met “one person” she dated “because they were a fan of his.”</p><p>She said: “They asked me to go out with him when they were with me so that they could meet him.”</p><p>During her WWHL appearance on Tuesday, Cohen was determined to “crack the case” and continued to press the “Let’s Be Honest” podcast host about Wallen.</p><p>“So, you went on a date with him, because your kids are big fans,” the <a href=#>WWHL host declared</a>. Cavallari replied, “I don’t know. I don’t know.”</p><p>She put an end to the conversation with a “zipping her lips” motion, laughing with Cohen as fellow WWHL guest <a href=#><strong>Whitney Rose</strong></a> of <a href=#>Real Housewives of Salt Lake City</a> quipped, “Who paid?”</p><p>Rumors about Cavallari and Wallen briefly swirled in June after Instagram gossip blog DeuxMoi received an anonymous tip that they had been spotted in Nashville together.</p><p>While she has yet to confirm any relationship, Cavallari did tease her <a href=#>plans to “reveal” her boyfriend</a>.</p><p>“I mean it,” she shared on the premiere episode of <a href=#>the “Let’s Be Honest” podcast</a>, released on Tuesday, September 12. “I’m going to actually tell you what’s going on in my life, who my boyfriend is and I’m going to dig into it all.”</p><p>Cavallari was married to ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Jay Cutler</strong></a> for seven years. The couple called it quits in April 2020 and <a href=#>their divorce was finalized</a> two years later.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since then, she’s been on the dating scene — but&nbsp; one thing Cavallari won’t do <a href=#>is get on any dating apps</a>.</p><p>“People really swear by the [dating] apps. They really do,” she told Us. “All of my friends are trying to get me on the apps, but I really believe — I really do — if a guy is supposed to come into my life, he will come into my life one way or another.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakqpmowaq6jJyYr5mcoa6ztYyam52qlajApr%2BMpqarn5Gjerity6Wcp2WUlsGqusZmqa6ln6fAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
