Whether it's a housekeeper who comes once a week or a babysitter to watch the kids every now and then, everyone could certainly use some help. But <a href=#>Joel Osteen</a> has more than just help, he has a household staff. Yes, not unlike power couple&nbsp;<a href=#>Kanye West</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> and other&nbsp;<a href=#>celebs who love him</a>, Osteen has a literal team of people helping him run his life and his home.</p><p>As Osteen told <a href=#>People</a> in an interview, the family has staff to help with "the cooking, cleaning, and driving," but that's not all. People also reported that Osteen's children have private tutors. All that help has to add up, especially when you take into consideration just how many staff members the Osteen family likely employs.</p><p>After all, you could reason that it takes more than one person to keep a <a href=#>17,000-square-foot home</a> clean, and then there's the lawn, the cars, the errands that need to be run. It's a lot, and Osteen probably spends a good chunk of his money on employing his staff. But whatever it takes to keep a household running smoothly, right?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2hobn9xe9OhnGaln6jBbrHXqZynq5mrsm7Ax6KloKtdn7ymuIyoqq2dlaN6sMPNrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
