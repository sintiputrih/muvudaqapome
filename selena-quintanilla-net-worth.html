She has two older siblings, A.B. Quintanilla and Suzette Quintanilla, who were members of her band, Selena y Los Dinos, before the group became known mononymously as Selena. Selena released her first single, “Contigo Quiero Estar,” with EMI Latin in 1989, but it was her 1992 smash hit, “Como la Flor,” that made her the Queen of Tejano music we remember today. The single peaked at number 6 on the U.S. Latin Chart. Afterward, Selena followed the song with hits like “Amor Prohibido,” “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,” “No Me Queda Más” and “Fotos y Recuerdos,” which all reached number 1 on the U.S. Latin Chart. In 1994, Selena won her first and only Grammy for Best Mexican/American Album for her 1993 LP Live!.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Beyonce-Selena.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Selena-Quintanilla-3.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena died in March 1995</a> at the age of 23 when she was shot and killed by Yolanda Saldivar, her friend and the former president of her fan club.

She’s the one not part of this trio anymore,” Suzette, who is an executive producer on Selena: The Series, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2020. “It had a lot of mixed emotions, if anything. I’m forever grateful and I’m grateful for the platform Netflix is able to give us, to be able to talk about this series. I don’t think that a lot of people realize that this type of platform is not given to everyone, especially us as Mexican-Americans.”</p><h2>What is Selena Quintanilla’s net worth?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Selena was worth $10 million at the time o her death in 1995.
