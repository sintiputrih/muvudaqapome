Others intervened to pull the women apart as Juliette yelled, “Listen, me not being friends with you has nothing to do with our friend group.”</p><p>Juliette and Robby, 32, ultimately <a href=#>split in June 2019 after three months of dating</a>. While she told Us that she <a href=#>regretted blindsiding</a> the <a href=#>Bachelorette</a> alum with their breakup, Chloe doubled down on her opinion of him.</p><p>“It’s fine,” the Concept by Chloe creator said of the awkward moment. “It’s his karma he gets for using you for fame.”</p><p>Chloe, for her part, considers everything from her <a href=#>time on the show to be worth the experience</a>. “I really don’t regret anything that I’ve ever done in my life,” she insisted. “I definitely have not been perfect, and my words have always not been anointed and they have not always been kind, but they have taught me a lot, and I’m just really, really grateful that I’ve gone through this transformation I’ve gone through because I look back and I know everything I don’t want to be because of it, and life is forever a lesson. No one gets to the finish line and is like, ‘I’m perfect now.’”</p><p>Chloe announced in January that she was <a href=#>briefly leaving Siesta Key</a>. She told Us earlier this month that she “took a huge step back” and spent some time “growing” during her break. “It’s a pretty big shock to everyone,” she teased. “And it was a <a href=#>big shock to the cast members</a> as well.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When she returned, Chloe allowed the “inner work” she did to be reflected in her actions. “[While filming I tried] not falling into the same old patterns of getting involved in the negative [moments], talk[ing] about others and all of that,” she noted. “It was really challenging.”</p><p>Watch the video above to see more of the cast’s biggest regrets from the show!</p><p>Siesta Key airs on MTV Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqinaOprm63xLKqZqKlobamwNOeZKmnoqmys3nRnp6rnaSoeqS0y6icZqyilsK1ucCnZJ%2Bhl53BcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
