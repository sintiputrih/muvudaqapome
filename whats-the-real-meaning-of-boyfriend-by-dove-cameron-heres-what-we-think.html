The sound was particularly embraced by the LGBTQ+ community, mostly due to its unapologetic sapphic lyrics. Less than a month after "Boyfriend" went live, Cameron finally blessed her fans with the full-length version. (This, too, went viral, eventually garnering roughly 500,000 streams per day on Spotify, as&nbsp;<a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>&nbsp;reported in March).&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after the release of the track, Cameron took to social media to express the importance of LGBTQ+ visibility. "This means more to me than anything. I feel this in my entire body," <a href=#>she wrote on Twitter</a>. "Queer representation in music, releasing songs the way straight artist sexy love songs about the objects of their affections MATTERS."</p><p>Cameron gave further insight into the track in a March interview with <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter.</a> When asked about her initial reaction to releasing the full record, she revealed that she was "terrified."&nbsp;The reason? "The feeling of having people like something in theory for a week, and then delivering on it, I was ready to die," she explained. Fortunately for Cameron, the track has continued to reach the masses, with it gaining over 30 million streams on Spotify in two weeks, per Rolling Stone. But the song's commercial success wasn't the only thing the singer was worried about.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcHFlbIZ5e9ahmK2rXam1pnnRnpilZZ2arq%2B1zaBkqJ5dl7y6stGinKecXZfGbrDOr5xmm5GisrO7zWafnqqVqHq4tMCtZLCdXam1qrrKaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
