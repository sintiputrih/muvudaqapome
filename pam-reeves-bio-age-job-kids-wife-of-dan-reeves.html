There was one story that stood out and former American football player Terry Bradshaw revealed to Cris Collinsworth, James Brown, and Howie Long saying, “We all love Dan Reeves. He’s truly a man’s man.”</p><p>He explained a story saying that he was standing by Pam when Terry’s statement was broadcast. Pam quipped in response, “It’s a good thing he’s a man’s man because if he were a ladies’ man, he’d be a dead man!”</p><p>Dan was a devoted husband to Pam and a father to their three children. Pam’s daughter-in-law Tara Reeves often featured Pam and her late husband Dan on her socials.</p><h3><strong>How Many Kids Did Pam And Dan Reeves Have?</strong></h3><p>Pam and her husband Dan were parents to three children Lee Reeves, Laura Reeves, and Dana Reeves.</p><p>Lee Reeves, who celebrates his birthday on 4 November, was married to Tara McClary Reeves. Tara hailed from <span class=nc684nl6>Pawleys Island, South Carolina</span> who studied Political Science at Furman University. She worked at the Medical University of South Carolina and the South Carolina Governor’s Mansion.</p><p>Tara is also a published author of a children’s book who wrote Point Me To Jesus, Is Your Dad Pirate?, Don’t Tell That to Beasley, and a few others. Lee and Tara are parents to three children Caroline, Daniel, and Harrison. She is available on <a href=#>Instagram</a> as well as <a href=#>Facebook.</a></p><p>In an article by Charisma Mag, she stated that their son Daniel was diagnosed with leukemia a month shy of his kindergarten graduation.</p><p>Moving on, Pam’s daughter <a href=#>Laura</a> appeared on a few posts by Tara Reeves.</p><p>Pam’s third child is Dana Reeves DeCamillis. Dana currently lives in Westlake Village, California. She and her husband Joe DeCamillis started dating in 1986 after meeting her on a homecoming weekend at the University of Wyoming. At the time, the Jaguars’ special teams coach and Denver-area native didn’t know for several weeks she was the daughter of then-Broncos head coach Dan Reeves.</p><p>Dana attended the University of Colorado before transferring to Wyoming.</p><p>Joe and Dana were <a href=#>married</a> on July 16, 1987, just before their senior year at Wyoming.

Talking about her husband, <a href=#>Joe</a> is an NFL coach and has been the special teams’ coordinator for the <a href=#>Los Angeles Rams</a>&nbsp;since&nbsp;2021.</p><h3><strong>Pam Reeves Age</strong></h3><p>Since Pam’s husband, who was born on 19 January 1944 and died on 1 January 2022, was 77 years old at the time of his death, Pam should be over 74 as of this writing.</p><h3><strong>Pam Reeves Job</strong></h3><p>Pam Reeves had a job as a mother but her work to make a living is not clear. As for her husband, <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>Dan played high school football, basketball, and baseball. From 1962 to 1964, he played quarterback at the </span>University of South Carolina.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Dan joined with the Cowboys in 1965 after going undrafted by any team in the National Football League or the American Football League. He played as a running back. He played eight seasons and rushed for 1,990 yards, including 757 in 1966, his best year.</p><p>One of his career highlights came in the 1967 N.F.L. championship game, dubbed the “Ice Bowl” due to the freezing temperatures at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis., where the Cowboys faced the Packers in one of the league’s most dramatic battles.</p><p>With the Packers leading 14-10 in the fourth quarter, Dan took a pitch from quarterback Don Meredith and fired a 50-yard touchdown pass to Lance Rentzel.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">“When we pitched it out and I was running with the ball,” Dan<a class=css-1g7m0tk title href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;told NFL Films,</a> “I noticed both the safety and corner coming up, which meant that Rentzel would be open.” He added further, “When I threw it I thought I had a chance to overthrow it, but the wind was in our face and thank goodness it held it up.”</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Landry promoted Dan to backfield coach in 1970. At the time, he was still an active player.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">“You think you’re pretty smart after a few years in the league as a player,” Dan revealed to The Associated Press before the 1970 season. “But you get into the coaching end and you realize how much work is involved in learning the game.”</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Dan took over the Falcons in 1997 after coaching the Broncos and Giants. He swiftly turned Atlanta into one of the greatest clubs in the N.F.L. after a 7-9 first season. The following season, the club went 14-2, with Jamal Anderson, the outstanding running back, gaining 1,846 yards.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">But as the Falcons were en route to their 12th victory, against the Saints in New Orleans in mid-December, Dan felt a burning sensation in his chest and throat; a day later, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">He missed the Falcons’ final two regular-season games, but he returned for the team’s playoff run, which culminated in a Super Bowl appearance against the Broncos, a battle between Reeves and Shanahan. The Broncos were victorious, 34-19.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Dan claimed the title of A.P. coach of the year for a second time.</p><h3><strong>Is Pam Reeves On Instagram, Facebook?</strong></h3><p>No, Pam Reeves is not on Instagram as well as Facebook.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>What Is Pam Reeves Maiden Name?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>The only known family member of Pam Reeves is her mother <a href=#>Laura White</a>.
