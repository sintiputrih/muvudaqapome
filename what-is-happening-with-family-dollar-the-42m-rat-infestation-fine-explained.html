Unsanitary may be an understatement; the place sounded absolutely filthy, with live rats, dead rats, and rat droppings everywhere. It’s basically a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rat musical</a> in that place. It sounds like they were truly the ones running the show, and for all we know, they could have been. This particular warehouse delivered 404 Family Dollar stores across six states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee.</p><h2 id=h-the-timeline data-injectable=false>The timeline</h2><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS News</a>, the problems started way back in August of 2020. A few issues with rodents and contaminated products were reported as deliveries were being sent out to stores. It seems nothing was really acknowledged until the following year, as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a> reports that the plea agreement stated the rats had “established a presence” in July 2021. A complaint was also filed by an employee a month later.</p><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>In January 2022, the Food and Drug Administration looked into the matter and their investigation “revealed live rodents, dead and decaying rodents, rodent feces, urine, and odors, and evidence of gnawing and nesting throughout the facility.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The press release from the FDA</a> claims that 1,270 rodents were exterminated the following month whilst the company mass recalled products and stores were temporarily closed. Basically, the facility had become the equivalent of a New York City alleyway.</p><h2 id=h-the-fine data-injectable=false>The fine</h2><p data-characters=815 data-current-count=815 data-injectable=true>Family Dollar would have certainly known about the issues in the warehouse. The company faced heavy criticism from Jonathan D. Ross, the Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, who said, “It is incomprehensible that Family Dollar knew about the rodent and pest issues at its distribution center in Arkansas but continued to ship products that were unsafe.” The company ultimately reached a plea agreement ending up with a fine of $41.7 million. The charge is for one misdemeanor count of holding products in unsanitary conditions, making it the largest criminal penalty in a food safety case ever. That’s bad, but it’s nothing compared to what <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyundi and Kia are paying out in their recent lawsuits</a> (and there’s no word yet on what may or may not happen with that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Willy Wonka disaster</a>).</p><h2 id=h-the-aftermath data-injectable=false>The aftermath</h2><p data-characters=590 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=false>Rick Dreilling, the chairman and CEO of Dollar Tree (Family Dollar’s parent company) released a statement assuring customers that the company had worked to “significantly enhance [its] policies.” Thank you, Captain Obvious, we would certainly hope so. The plea agreement also means that Family Dollar must meet “robust corporate compliance and reporting requirements for the next three years,” according to the FDA. Again, thank goodness. If there’s anything we don’t need right now, it’s Beyoncé needing to change the lyrics to “Who Run the World?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeWrrZww8eaq2aho2K1orzPnqWippdixKrAx2admqWZocZusM6lo5qqXam1pnmTa6RmqpGpeqq6xZ6qrZmknryvecWipZ5lla29ra3Ip5ydZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
