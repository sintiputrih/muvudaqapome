We never spoke of that, I didn't want her to know. In the hospital I slept there every night and Kaley would come every morning."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d074bc07a13a-vinnie-jones-t.jpg><p id=em3VPN9GBGX data-wc=49>Opening up on her <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>final moments</a>, Vinnie revealed he was by Tanya's side as she passed away.

I'd do it to be a laug</strong>h – it was like inviting the [expletive] court jester. I'd be really funny and then there was a point where it levelled and came back the other way. I don't think alcohol was my hook, I think it was the sugar. The sugar got me to a [expletive] buzzing place, but once the alcohol kicked in, I was kind of paranoid. I was very defensive if someone was negative towards me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4dfa5a1b0f7d-vinnie-jones-gentlemen.jpg><p id=eyS7dO5v6ujg data-wc=51>Addressing his sobriety back in 2013, Vinnie said: "The less I drink, the more my anger fades. I think that's how it started in the first place. My parents got divorced when I was young, and alcohol seemed to trigger everything off. The problem's not the bottle – it's the case.&nbsp;</p><p id=exuDWDDVfrJl data-wc=25>"I'm the case or nothing, last man standing," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">The Guardian</a>, adding that at the time he hadn't had a drink for six months.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
