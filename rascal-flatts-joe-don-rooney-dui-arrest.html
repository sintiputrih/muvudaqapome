Formed in 1999, the country trio is best known for their hit songs “Bless the Broken Road,” “Life is a Highway,” and “Mayberry.” Last January, the group announced their retirement and a subsequent farewell tour, but the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic halted the tour.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In April, Jay and Gary gave an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>update about whether the farewell tour</a> would be rescheduled. “The short answer is, there is nothing in the works as of right now,” Jay told Big Machine Records. “You know, unfortunately, we were supposed to have retired and then everybody committed to other things this year.
