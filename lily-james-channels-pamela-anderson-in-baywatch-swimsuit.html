The British actress transformed into Anderson circa 1992 while shooting in Malibu on Wednesday, May 12.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Lily-James-Channels-Pamela-Andersons-Baywatch-Days-Iconic-Red-Suit-003.jpg><p>In multiple photos, published by the <a href=#>Daily Mail </a>on Friday, May 14, James ran up and down the beach in the red one-piece, which <a href=#>Anderson wore for seven seasons on the hit series</a> as C.J. Parker. Her blonde wig and fake breast implants made the <a href=#>Downton Abbey</a> alum look like the former Playboy model’s twin.</p><p>During her time on <a href=#>Baywatch</a>, Anderson’s character and fellow lifeguards, including Mitch Buchannon (<a href=#><strong>David Hasselhoff</strong></a>), became known for their sand sprints. Fans tuned in to watch the attractive lifeguards jog along the beach and into the water to assist with daring saves.</p><p>On Wednesday, <a href=#>the Cinderella actress</a> showed off her tanned skin and slim figure in another snap. She posed with her hands on her waist, similar to Anderson’s memorable TV stills from the ‘90s and highlighted the swimsuit’s high leg line.</p><p>A week prior, Hulu released the first photos from the upcoming show <a href=#>featuring an unrecognizable James as Anderson</a> as Stan, 38, and Lee, now 58.</p><p>In one photo, the Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again star bit the Falcon and the Winter Solider actor’s nipple ring as he screamed. Stan’s transformation included tattoos all over his arms and torso reminiscent of the Mötley Crüe rocker.</p><p>James also appeared in a solo shot wearing a black lace-up corset and matching leather pants. Her blonde locks and edgy makeup added to her portrayal of the model.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Hulu series is dubbed a comedy that focuses on the <a href=#>release of Anderson and Lee’s 1995 sex tape</a>.

They share two sons, Brandon, 24, and <a href=#>Dylan</a>, 23.</p><p>Anderson was later married to <a href=#><strong>Kid Rock</strong></a> from 2006 to 2007 and <strong>Rick Salomon</strong> from 2007 to 2008 and again from 2014 to 2015.
