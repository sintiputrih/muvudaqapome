The chill also left those of us backstage relying on coffee, Moet Champagne and lukewarm lasagne to keep warm – especially after a long four hours on the red carpet, standing in one spot with (most of us) dressed for the occasion, not the weather.&nbsp;</p><p id=eJx1vckmCb data-wc=56>My day began with the glam squad (me) choosing a messy bun for my blonde locks, and working with my jetlagged dehydrated skin to try and attempt a glowing red carpet look, as my stylist (also me) picked out a silk wrap dress from the back of my closet (designer unknown) and a Nadine Merabi blazer.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/72de9c94334f-gettyimages-1908171125.jpg><p id=eW7e0xzBPY data-wc=79>Then, lest you think I lead a glamorous A-list life, I drove myself to a parking garage near a mall where I waited in line in the cold to sit on a shuttle bus to be taken to the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where I then stood, in the cold, in strappy heels (note to self: wear uggs under a ballgown next time), for four hours to wait and see what celebrities may deign to talk to us mere mortals.&nbsp;</p><p id=e34GiAsnhv data-wc=50>A computer glitch meant that the red carpet started late, as credentials were unable to be printed properly, but the kind ladies and gents serving the Moet kept it flowing -- along with the water -- and a quick walk down the carpet saw old and new friends say hello.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/51e31da7b78a-gettyimages-1908157455.jpg><p id=eE0ixDy_FA data-wc=50>Our spot was near the entrance and opposite WWD's platform, which has its advantages and disadvantages – people are more likely to want to get inside by that point, but as they wait for their fashion moment, I can shout their name and try to get an answer or two.&nbsp;</p><p id=esVC_jnM1h data-wc=92>And was it worth it in the end? Yes. <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Angela Bassett was one of the lucky ones who spoke to me, and she gossiped happily about&nbsp;9-1-1,</a>before sharing what we can expect from season seven, while star Gabriel Macht introduced me to his mom and shared his thoughts on the reboot, Lisa Ann Walter dished on season three of and Marcus Mumford said "hello" as he rushed by with Carey Mulligan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/089750969459-gettyimages-1908161895.jpg><p id=eRfCeMjS6a data-wc=46>Plus I got to hear<a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;Emma Stone</a> speak about her friendship with Taylor Swift and jokingly call the superstar an "[expletive]," before sharing how she was "very happy" that her friend was at the show, where the pop star was spotted cheering on Emma's big win.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUzGF247EJ data-wc=57>"Pick me for a question," I thought to myself as I held up the card that read HELLO in big bold letters, and Emma stood with her co-stars including Willem Dafoe and director Yorgos Lanthimos. I wanted to ask Emma and Yorgos a question<a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;about Joe Alwyn and their next project together, Kind of Kindness.&nbsp;</a></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=e5UXhU2jm2s data-wc=23>Alas, it seems three questions from the fellow sitting next to me about<strong>&nbsp;Jeremy Allen White's underwear was enough nonsense for one night.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eIHkTNaOgz data-wc=56>Speaking of, star Jeremy - who broke the internet days prior with his Calvin Klein commercial – quipped that it had been "a weird few days," but that winning the Golden Globe, his second in a row, was a moment he was more proud of then having his six-pack become the world's talking point.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/affda34d6e9a-gettyimages-1908169191.jpg><p id=eQC6DpwoF18 data-wc=46>Backstage there were cheers forthree wins, including one for Ayo Edibiri, who also starred in this year's wild comedy , and who told <strong>HELLO</strong>! that she feels that "people have been craving good comedy but now studios are realizing that audiences are intelligent".&nbsp;</p><p id=e7-nYJtTVWR data-wc=66><strong>It was a history-making night&nbsp;</strong>as star Steven Yeun became the first Asian actor to win Best Actor in a limited Series, and Ali Wong, his co-star won Best Actress in a Limited Series, making her the first Asian actress to win this category.

She later told <strong>HELLO</strong>! the decision was one that felt "natural," because "it is often how I introduce myself to new people, especially when it is significant".&nbsp;</p><p id=ekBSLH51iwR data-wc=49>Elsewhere in the TV categories, <strong>Elizabeth Debecki picked up the sole award forn,&nbsp;</strong>sharing that what struck her the most about <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Princess Diana</a> was a "combination of the isolation, and emergence from it, and desire to recreate the self and to control the narrative of one's life".&nbsp;</p><p id=enYDM1w8693 data-wc=31>"I learned a lot from playing this part; the courage it takes and inherent beauty in that life path.
