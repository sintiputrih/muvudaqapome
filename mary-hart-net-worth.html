All of her efforts have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Mary Hart? As of mid-2016, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $10 million, mostly earned through her work on television. Aside from that, she was also Miss South Dakota 1970, and gained popularity in pageants at a young age. She also has a very diverse tenure in terms of television work, and all of these have ensured the position of her wealth.</p><h3>Mary Hart Net Worth $10 million</h3><p>At a young age, Mary started competing in pageants and eventually became Miss South Dakota in 1970. This led her to become a part of the 1971 Miss America pageant, placing in the semi-finals. She attended and matriculated from Augustana Academy, before going to Augustana College. After finishing her studies, she would teach English at Washington High School for two years, while anchoring her own talk show on KSFY-TV.</p><p>Eventually, Hart started focusing on a television career, becoming part of KMTV in Omaha. In 1976, she moved to KTVY in Oklahoma City, and became part of the show “Dannysday”. While there, she also worked as a sales representative for a company focused on making school yearbooks. Three years later, she decided to move to Los Angeles and leave journalism behind. She was cast in “Days of Our Lives”, and made a few television commercials too. She struggled to find a stable job, but was then hired to co-host the show “PM Magazine”, which would lead her to the short lived <a href=#>Regis Philbin </a>talk show on NBC. After the show was cancelled, she was interviewed by “Entertainment Tonight”, and became an ET correspondent. Eventually, she worked her way up to become the co-host of the show; her net worth was rising significantly.</p><p>Mary would stay the host of “Entertainment Tonight” despite numerous changes to her co-host – she worked with Robb Weller, Ron Hendren, <a href=#>John Tesh</a>, and Bob Goen. Her popularity would increase because of the show, and it led her to become an endorser for Hanes. Her legs were also insured, but she would eventually become the face of “Entertainment Tonight”. In 1987, she made a guest appearance in “WrestleMania III”, and a year later performed on stage with <a href=#>David Brenner</a>. She continued to work with “Entertainment Tonight” despite her numerous projects. In 1991, it was reported that her voice triggered seizures in an epileptic woman, and this led to numerous comedic references in various shows such as “Seinfeld” and “The Fairly OddParents”.</p><p>After 29 years with “Entertainment Tonight”, Hart announced that she was leaving the show, stating that she wanted change. She still makes occasional appearances in the show, last appearing in the October 29, 2015 episode.</p><p>For her personal life, it is known that Hart has been married to film producer <a href=#>Burt Sugarman </a>since 1989, and they have a son. The couple owns numerous homes including a condo at the Ritz-Carlton Residences in LA and two Montana mansions. She is known as a convert to Judaism. She is a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, performing the national anthem at several games.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=9.8234295415959><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Mary Hart</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 8, 1950</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Madison, South Dakota, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.68 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Augustana University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Burt Sugarman (m. 1989), Terry Hart (m. 1972–1979)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Alec Jay Sugarman</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Dorothy Harum</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Michael Harum, David Harum</td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/maryhart</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0366433/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Program</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Movies</td><td>An American Carol, Fairly OddBaby, Marci X, Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, Love Affair</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Entertainment Tonight</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=6><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=12><td>1</td><td>I really wanted to contact the woman, but I was, I wanted to call her and tell her I was really sorry, but I was afraid I'd kill her.
