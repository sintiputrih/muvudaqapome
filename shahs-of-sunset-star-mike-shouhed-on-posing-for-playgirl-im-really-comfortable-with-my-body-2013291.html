I’m naked all the time at home. So I’m just going to act as if it’s me at home getting naked.”</p><p>That said, he’s also going to try to enjoy the moment as much as possible. “I haven’t really decided what Playgirl‘s going to get, but it’s going to be fun,” he says. “I want to keep it very classy, very sexy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s tough,” he adds, “but I’m excited about it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The Bravo standout also dished to <strong>Us</strong> about the unexpected success of his reality series, which follows a group of Persian-American friends living in Beverly Hills. “I wouldn’t have believed that the show would be such a cult favorite.
