Haven’t really moved in the past 2+ days, and [have] been receiving lots of help from my amazing husband and the grandmas,” the <a href=#>Duck Dynasty</a> star, 23, wrote via her Instagram Story on Friday, May 21.</p><p>She continued, “However I have had the best cuddles ever from the snuggle bug 😍. I will say postpartum has been so special in a million ways (truly), but the pain is real and can’t just be ignored. Learning to be still and accept help so that I can be the best mom I can to my baby girl.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sadie-Robertson-Talks-Postpartum-Journey-Says-the-Pain-Is-Real-One-Week-After-Giving-Birth.jpg><p>The Louisiana native <a href=#>welcomed her daughter</a>, Honey James Huff, with her husband, <a href=#><strong>Christian Huff</strong></a>, on May 11.</p><p>“We saw a million little miracles yesterday — the best one being this girl right here,” she <a href=#>wrote</a> via Instagram the following day. “Honey 💛 The pure goodness of God. Story to come, but I’m way too occupied right now by cuteness.”</p><p>A week after giving birth, she shared a list of lessons she’d learned from her daughter.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[One] week and you’ve officially changed me for the better. I’ve learned that before I ever get to really teach you a thing you will teach me a million,” the Live Fearless author <a href=#>wrote</a> via Instagram. “To see a miracle you have to go through a moment of desperation, fear and even pain, but none of those feelings compare to the gratitude of receiving the miracle.”</p><p>Robertson <a href=#>announced her pregnancy</a> in October 2020 with an Instagram photo of her and her husband holding up ultrasound images. Two months later, she revealed that she <a href=#>first felt like a mom</a> while <a href=#>battling COVID-19</a> early in her pregnancy during an exclusive interview with Us Weekly.</p><p>“I knew I needed to go to the hospital, and typically [I would not have]. Like, I’ll just recover. I’ll be fine. But in that moment, I was like, ‘No. We have to make sure the baby’s OK,’” she said. “It [was] not really about me. It was more about her and getting health for her. So that was a really cool thing to go through even though it was hard.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasmZSesm6%2Bzpucq6yjpLtuv8CyqmasmJp6sa3Ip2Siq12nsqK4jJqdrZ2iYrSqwsinnmaamafBqXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
