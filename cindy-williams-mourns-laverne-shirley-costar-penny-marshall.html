My good friend Penny Marshall is gone — one in a million,” the 71-year-old said in a statement to <i>Us Weekly</i>&nbsp;on Wednesday, December 19. “Utterly unique, a truly great talent. And, oh, what fun we had! Can’t describe how I’ll miss her.”</p><p>Williams played happy-go-lucky brewery worker Shirley Feeney to Marshall’s Laverne DeFazio in the Happy Days spinoff, which aired from 1976 to 1983 and became the No. 1 show on television midway through its run.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Laverne-Shirley-2.jpg><p>The two actresses remained friends off-screen for decades and even reunited on TV for a 2013 episode of Sam & Cat. “We see each other all the time,” Williams told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2015. “We watch TV together. She likes to watch television in the arctic, so she actually has jackets in her room.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed Marshall’s death on Tuesday, December 18. Her family told Us in a statement that the actress — who also directed such films as Big and A League of Their Own — died from diabetes complications at her Hollywood Hills home.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Penny was a tomboy who loved sports, doing puzzles of any kind, drinking milk and Pepsi together and being with her family,” the statement read. “As an actress, her work on Laverne & Shirley broke ground featuring blue-collar women entertaining America in prime time … Penny was a girl from the Bronx, who came out West, put a cursive ‘L’ on her sweater and transformed herself into a Hollywood success story. We hope her life continues to inspire others to spend time with family, work hard and make all of their dreams come true.”</p><p>A celebration of Marshall’s life will be held at a later date to be announced, the family added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoZ6Zxm7DyKWjopmdqHquu9SrpaxlnJbDpr7NnmSsoJmnuabFjJymrKyRp3qxsc2nsGalkafAqa3LpWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
