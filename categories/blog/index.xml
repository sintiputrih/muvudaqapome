One thing that has always set NVIDIA apart from AMD is their willingness to use non-power of 2 memory bus sizes. AMD always sticks to 256/128/64 bit busses, while NVIDA has used those along with interesting combinations such as 384, 320, and 192 bit busses. This can allow NVIDIA to tap more memory bandwidth by having a wider bus, however they also usually run their memory slower than AMD’s memory on comparable products, so NVIDIA’s memory bandwidth advantage isn’t quite as pronounced.</description></item><item><title>Jessica Vosk Net Worth 2024</title><link>/jessica-vosk-net-worth-289552.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/jessica-vosk-net-worth-289552.html</guid><description>Jessica Vosk is an American stage actress born on September 30, 1983.
