This does several things, including better benchmark results at stock settings (not entirely needed if overclocking is an end-user goal) at the expense of heat and temperature. It also gives in essence an automatic overclock which may be against what the user wants. Our testing methodology is ‘out-of-the-box’, with the latest public BIOS installed and XMP enabled, and thus subject to the whims of this feature. It is ultimately up to the motherboard manufacturer to take this risk – and manufacturers taking risks in the setup is something they do on every product (think C-state settings, USB priority, DPC Latency / monitoring priority, memory subtimings at JEDEC). Processor speed change is part of that risk, and ultimately if no overclocking is planned, some motherboards will affect how fast that shiny new processor goes and can be an important factor in the system build.</p><p>For our tests today, it would seem that all the motherboards had some form of MultiCore Turbo, although because we are testing with a JEDEC memory kit, some are more ‘turned on’ than others. The GIGABYTE and ASUS motherboards seemed more content at stock and mid-turbo frequencies, whereas the MSI and ASRock were more aggressive.</p><p><b>Point Calculations – 3D Movement Algorithm Test: <a href=#>link</a></b></p><p>3DPM is a self-penned benchmark, taking basic 3D movement algorithms used in Brownian Motion simulations and testing them for speed. High floating point performance, MHz and IPC wins in the single thread version, whereas the multithread version has to handle the threads and loves more cores.</p><p><img alt="3D Particle Movement: Single Threaded" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8557/67858.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="3D Particle Movement: MultiThreaded" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8557/67859.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The MSI takes a commanding lead in the multi-threaded version of the test.</p><p><b>Compression – WinRAR 5.0.1: <a href=#>link</a></b></p><p>Our WinRAR test from 2013 is updated to the latest version of WinRAR at the start of 2014. We compress a set of 2867 files across 320 folders totaling 1.52 GB in size – 95% of these files are small typical website files, and the rest (90% of the size) are small 30 second 720p videos.</p><p><img alt="WinRAR 5.01, 2867 files, 1.52 GB" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8557/67857.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In comparison, the ASRock wins here.</p><p><b>Image Manipulation – FastStone Image Viewer 4.9: <a href=#>link</a></b></p><p>Similarly to WinRAR, the FastStone test us updated for 2014 to the latest version. FastStone is the program I use to perform quick or bulk actions on images, such as resizing, adjusting for color and cropping. In our test we take a series of 170 images in various sizes and formats and convert them all into 640x480 .gif files, maintaining the aspect ratio. FastStone does not use multithreading for this test, and thus single threaded performance is often the winner.</p><p><img alt="FastStone Image Viewer 4.9" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8557/67860.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The split between MSI/ASRock against ASUS/GIGABYTE results in a one second gap in our FastStone test.</p><p><b>Video Conversion – Handbrake v0.9.9: <a href=#>link</a></b></p><p>Handbrake is a media conversion tool that was initially designed to help DVD ISOs and Video CDs into more common video formats. The principle today is still the same, primarily as an output for H.264 + AAC/MP3 audio within an MKV container. In our test we use the same videos as in the Xilisoft test, and results are given in frames per second.</p><p><img alt="HandBrake v0.9.9 LQ Film" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8557/67855.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="HandBrake v0.9.9 2x4K" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8557/67856.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Interestingly here the ASUS and GIGABYTE pull ahead during the low quality test, but at 4K the ASRock scores the points.</p><p><b>Rendering – PovRay 3.7: <a href=#>link</a></b></p><p>The Persistence of Vision RayTracer, or PovRay, is a freeware package for as the name suggests, ray tracing. It is a pure renderer, rather than modeling software, but the latest beta version contains a handy benchmark for stressing all processing threads on a platform. We have been using this test in motherboard reviews to test memory stability at various CPU speeds to good effect – if it passes the test, the IMC in the CPU is stable for a given CPU speed. As a CPU test, it runs for approximately 2-3 minutes on high end platforms.</p><p><img alt="POV-Ray 3.7 Beta RC4" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8557/67862.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>MultiCore Turbo affects motherboards more in tests such as POV-Ray, and the GIGABYTE drops down here.</p><p><b>Synthetic </b><b>– 7-Zip 9.2: <a href=#>link</a></b></p><p>As an open source compression tool, 7-Zip is a popular tool for making sets of files easier to handle and transfer. The software offers up its own benchmark, to which we report the result.</p><p><img alt="7-zip Benchmark" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8557/67861.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIV2gZZor3JxXaK8tbTEq5momaKZerO71KebrqhdlsC2v4yxcHJllJq5tsTEZp6in5GXxrWxjLFwcmWlmYRuwcNuZJqroqSwrHnXcnBmr6NiurS1jLFwcqtdqLmqec%2BlrKxlmaPBpriMoZisr5WhuW6xjmpq</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
