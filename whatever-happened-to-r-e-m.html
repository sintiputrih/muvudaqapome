Just six months later, the band announced that it was unequivocally, absolutely, and completely done. "As lifelong friends and co-conspirators, we have decided to call it a day as a band," read an announcement on the group's website (via <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>). "We walk away with a great sense of gratitude, of finality, and of astonishment at all we have accomplished." But why? Why <a href=#>end a band</a> after more than three decades of unbelievable success and musical experimentation? "The time just feels right," bassist Mike Mills added, assuring fans that "there's no disharmony here, no falling-outs, no lawyers-squaring off," and that the decision was made "together" and "amicably." Singer Michael Stipe later told <a href=#>Salon</a> that the group had been winding out since its 2008 tour.</p><p>In 2016, guitarist Peter Buck recalled the breakup discussion to <a href=#>Billboard</a>, saying, "We got together, and Michael [Stipe] said, 'I think you guys will understand. I need to be away from this for a long time.' And I said, 'How about forever?' Michael looked at Mike, and Mike said, 'Sounds right to me.' That's how we decided." Buck also chalks up the end to the not wanting to become an over-the-hill rock band that was just playing the hits. "We didn't want to keep doing 20-year-old songs."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9l29vb2tfrLWiwMSvnKtlmJa9sbHNnptmrJ9iv26xjKZm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
