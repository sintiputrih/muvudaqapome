Brie, who plays Ally, a Hollywood showrunner who returns home after losing her job, appears in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">several scenes of non-sexual nudity</a>, including an extensive streaking scene, as well as a segment about Ally’s dreams to produce a show on nudism. Brie seems so comfortable in her own skin — literally — that some are wondering whether or not the actor, who co-wrote the script along with her husband, director Dave Franco, dabbles in naturism in her personal life.</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Alison Brie (@alisonbrie)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=822 data-injectable=true>As it turns out, not only is Brie really just that comfortable being in the buff, she does have a history of public nudity dating back to her college days as a student at Cal Arts. At the time, the private art university had a clothing-optional policy (except for in the cafeteria) that Brie took full advantage of during her undergrad years. “Every now and then I would just throw on my tennies and take a jaunt… not all the time, just once in a while, to exercise my right!” she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Conan O’Brien</a> in 2012.<br></p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Brie would also take advantage of the lax attitude toward bare skin to cheer up her roommate at the time. “If my roommate was having a bad day and I wanted to make her laugh to feel better, I would sort of pretend like I was going to go take a shower but then I would sneak outside and hang from the tree outside our window. Like a monkey. Like a naked monkey.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Alison Brie (@alisonbrie)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>In a recent appearance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Jennifer Hudson Show</a> brie described herself as “a bit of a nudist” and admitted that she had streaked “as recent as last year.” Presumably, that doesn’t include her recent streaking post on Instagram done during Somebody’s press tour.</p><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=817 data-injectable=true>So while Brie doesn’t appear to be a practicing nudist per se, the comfort with her body that shines through in her naked performances in Somebody I Used to Know and GLOW <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is absolutely not an act.</a> In 2017 she told Playboy that “the hardest part [about nude scenes] is the transition from being in your robe to being naked on set. Once I was naked, it kind of reminded me of my nudist days from college and that feeling of, ‘Oh yeah, I love my body and this is fun and silly and it’s fine.'”</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=63 data-injectable=false>Somebody I Used to Know is currently streaming on Prime Video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlkaG2tLvNZpmroZVirm661J2grKxdnrtuvsSao2akmZuycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
