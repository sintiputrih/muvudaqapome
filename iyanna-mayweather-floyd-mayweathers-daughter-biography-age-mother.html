In October 2018, a music video titled&nbsp;</span><span>Oh Alright Remix</span><span>&nbsp;was released on YouTube.&nbsp;But a critical analysis of the views revealed that his striking style was central to his concerns.&nbsp;Iyanna has a YouTube channel and tries hard to keep it active.</span></p><p><span>But as the daughter of one of the most talented boxers of all time, she has achieved huge success on social media.&nbsp;With hundreds of thousands of people following her on Instagram and Twitter, Iyanna is nowhere below average in terms of social media presence.&nbsp;As for her popularity, Iyanna caught the public eye with lavish birthday parties sponsored by her father.</span></p><p><span>It doesn’t end there, her dad is known to spoil his daughter by giving her the most expensive things.&nbsp;On her 16th birthday, she invited musical artists such as Drake and Future to perform at her party and also received many gifts.&nbsp;This may seem like the highest of them all, but you will be amazed to know that on her 18th birthday, Iyanna Mayweather was gifted with an 18-carat “Canary PRISTINE” ring worth $5 million.&nbsp;Everything was glitzy at the birthday party celebrated by a host of celebrities.</span></p><p><span>All of these gifts made people wonder if she was her father’s favorite child.&nbsp;Another guess is that the boxer is probably trying to make up for his infamous relationship with Iyanna’s mother.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is his mother?</span></strong></h2><p><span>As we mentioned earlier, Iyanna Mayweather is Floyd’s only child with his one time girlfriend, Melissa Brim.&nbsp;Brim is said to have first met the boxer when she was a teenager.&nbsp;By the time they started dating, Melissa already had a son, Devion Cromwell, from a previous relationship, but that was never a problem for Floyd, who even reportedly adopted the child out of love for his mother. .&nbsp;But things quickly soured between them after Melissa got pregnant with Iyanna.&nbsp;According to some sources, they had a falling out at the time and later separated.</span></p><p><span>After Iyanna was born, the pair came back together again, Floyd did his best to catch up with the past.&nbsp;He helped her open a boutique, Devanna Love Boutique, named after her children.&nbsp;In 2012, the once beloved couple broke up again.&nbsp;It was a lousy episode with allegations of physical abuse against Melissa by Mayweather.&nbsp;Floyd got in trouble with the law and was placed under house arrest for a few days.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGihqZa7r62Mppiyr5WWwamx0WadpaepmXqurdiwnJqsmJq%2FtHnDmqygoKSav26uyKieq5mgncZurcaeZKanpJ2ys3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
