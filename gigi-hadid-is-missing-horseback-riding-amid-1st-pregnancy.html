Missing it!!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gigi-Hadid-Says-She-Is-Missing-Horseback-Riding-Amid-First-Pregnancy.jpg><p>The Los Angeles native has been “taking [her] time sharing” the ins and outs of her pregnancy, Hadid said in a July 2020 Instagram Live video while<a href=#> giving a glimpse of her bare baby bump</a>. She explained, “Right now I just want to experience it, and I just don’t wanna worry about waking up every day during my pregnancy and worry about having to look cute or post something.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in April that the<a href=#> Real Housewives of Beverly Hills </a>alum and her boyfriend, 27,&nbsp;are&nbsp;expecting&nbsp;their first child.</p><p>The couple are<a href=#>&nbsp;“closer than ever”&nbsp;</a>ahead of their little one. “Gigi has been living at her mom’s farm with Zayn,” a source exclusively told Us in July. “She came back to NYC recently but she plans to spend most of her pregnancy there at the farm.”</p><p>Hadid previously spoke about her plans to have kids when she got “older,” telling i-D magazine in February: “One day I’ll start a family. I don’t know if I will always be modeling. I love the creative side of fashion, it’s so fulfilling. … But who knows? Maybe I’ll take up full time cooking!”</p><p>Multiple sources confirmed to Us the previous month that she and the “Pillowtalk” were<a href=#> back together after two breakups</a>. “She’s always wanted to start a family with Zayn,” an insider told Us in January, noting that they’re “so in love” with each other.</p><p>The pair first started dating in 2015, then split three years later. They reunited soon after calling it quits, but <a href=#>broke up once more in January 2019</a>. Hadid “tried hard to make it work” with the X Factor alum, an insider shared at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGagoZeeeqmtw6KbZqGjYrqqv9KipaBlmKS%2FtLHBmpqkZaKesaq6xmaYpqGUYn60wIypqZ6fnpa7pMWO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
