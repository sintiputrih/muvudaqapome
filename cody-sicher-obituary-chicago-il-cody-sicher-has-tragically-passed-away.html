It was during this time that he discovered his true calling, dedicating himself to mastering the art of sound and leaving an indelible mark on the music industry.</p><p>Cody’s parents, Edward (Ghilder) Sicher and Pamela Hamblin, were not only the source of his existence but also the bedrock of his love, support, and guidance. Their unwavering belief in his talents and dreams allowed Cody to follow his heart and pursue his passion with relentless determination.</p><p>The love Cody shared with his grandparents was immeasurable.
