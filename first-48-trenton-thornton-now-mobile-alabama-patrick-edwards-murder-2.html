The Mobile police located Thornton the next day and took him under custody.</p><p>He was kept in the Mobile County Metro Jail. As per the investigators, the former marine fired three or four shots through the glass of the car.</p><p>Moreover, the suspect was charged with murder, firing into an occupied vehicle, and fleeing the crime scene. He appeared in court and his bond was set to $140,000.</p><p>We donâ€™t have any confirmation on whether the suspect paid the bail amount or he is in jail. Either way, he will be on trial soon.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=trenton-thornton-family-and-wikipedia-bio-to-explore></span>Trenton Thornton Family And Wikipedia Bio To Explore<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Trenton Thornton is a family man with a wife and children.</p><p>Besides, the suspect is also a former marine who did two tours overseas. He was respectfully discharged by the organization as well. It is yet to confirm what triggered the attack but it was quite brutal.</p><p>Upon arrest, Thornton also resisted it and a SWAT team had to storm inside his house. His trial is due sometime in 2022.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-trenton-thornton-on-jail-mobile-alabama-murder-case-update></span>Is Trenton Thornton On Jail? Mobile Alabama Murder Case Update<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Trenton Thornton was arrested and kept in the Mobile County Metro Jail.</p><p>However, the court has set him a bail of $175,000. It is very unlikely that the suspect paid the amount to disregard the jail time until his trial. So rumors say he is in jail.</p><p>The Mobile Alabama murder case is featured in an A&E documentary, First 48.
