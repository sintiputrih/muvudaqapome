People have&nbsp;found that out&nbsp;the hard way for years.&nbsp;<a href=# rel>Much was said about all the tats that Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson shared before their high-profile break-up</a> and even more recently, <a href=# rel>Blueface and Juice WRLD fell into the tattoo trap by getting ink dedicated to their girls</a>. <a href=# class=text-word rel>Jermaine Dupri</a> has been in the news for a whole other reason, <a href=# rel>going after the state of female rap right now and saying that everyone sounds the same</a>. He recently spoke to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Page Six</a> about&nbsp;a number of topics and when his past relationship with Janet Jackson was mentioned, JD spoke about the tattoo he got down his right side for her.</p><p>Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images</p><p>In case you forgot, Dupri got a giant portrait of Janet Jackson on his side when they were dating. If you ask him about it today though, he'll tell you he doesn't regret a thing about it. "I have a tattoo of her — but I know her," said the producer. "People have tattoos of people that they do not know. So when I got the Janet tattoo people were like, ‘What if y’all break up?’ But this is someone I know. I don’t regret Janet’s tattoo — we have matching ones."</p><p>JD has faced online criticism for failing to recognize major milestones in his ex-girlfriend's life, including her birthdays. He also touched on the backlash he's received by saying that not everything has to be done publicly. If he wants to wish Janet a happy birthday, he can literally pick up the phone and do so.</p><p>Would you/have you ever gotten your&nbsp;partner tattooed on your skin?</p><p>Dave Hogan/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiZ352gJVmoZ6qnZa2r7GMnaypqplitaK%2FjKemZqmllrmuv4yamaitpGK1qr%2BMoKCapqRit6K6xK1ko5mToMCwuoytmK2sn6R6r7HWrA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
