According to sources, Blake Anderson’s overall net worth is estimated to be $3 million. Blake has garnered his wealth through a flourishing career as a comedian predominantly on television. His association with the “Workaholics” sitcom not only elevated him to fame but also significantly contributed to his net worth. Given his ongoing involvement in the entertainment industry, his net worth continues to grow.</p><h3>Blake Anderson’s Net Worth: $3 Million</h3><p>Anderson attended Clayton Valley High School in Concord, California, where he was often ridiculed for his long, unkempt hair, which has now become one of his distinctive trademarks. During his formative years, he relocated to Los Angeles to collaborate with improvisational comedy troupes such as “Upright Citizens Brigade” and “The Groundlings”. In addition to this, Anderson also embarked on a national tour as a member of the National Lampoon Lemmings. As an attempt to support his education at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, he also worked part-time as a pizza delivery driver, where he crossed paths with his future colleague and friend, Adam DeVine.</p><p>In 2006, Blake founded a sketch comedy group known as Mail Order Comedy, with DeVine being a collaborator, among others. This collective swiftly gained prominence and consistently sold-out comedy shows across the United States. Anderson is the writer and producer of all its content, including “Workaholics”, a sitcom which premiered on Comedy Central in April 2011. In addition to being the writer and producer, Blake also frequently appears as an actor in most of his shows.</p><p>On the other hand, Anderson also performs stand-up comedies at renowned venues and has made appearances in several popular shows such as “Community”, “House M.D.”, “Special Delivery”, “Traffic Light”, and “Entourage”. He has also been featured in several films including National Lampoon’s “The Legend of Awesomest Maximus” (2009), “Ratko: The Dictator’s Son” (2009), “Epic” (2013), “Neighbours” (2014), and “Dope” (2015). Some of his other notable roles include appearances in “Community”, “Arrested Development”, and “Loiter Squad”. His recent endeavors involve appearances in episodes of the TV series “Comedy Bang! Bang!” and “Drunk History”, and a role in the 2015 film “Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse”. Anderson also had cameo appearances in FUN’s music video “We Are Young” and One Direction’s “One Thing” music video in 2011.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Blake Anderson tied the knot with Rachael Finley in September 2012, and the couple welcomed a daughter, Mars Aliah Anderson, in 2014. In 2011, an incident at his house party led to Anderson fracturing his spine, which required surgery, but the comedian made a successful recovery. Blake consistently supports the Hyphy hip-hop music scene in East Bay, California, and has expressed that Lil B is one of his favorite performers.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Blake Anderson</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 2, 1984</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Sacramento County, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Screenwriter, Film Producer, Comedian, Television producer</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Orange Coast College, Clayton Valley High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Rachael Finley (m. 2012)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Mars Ilah Anderson</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Uncle Blazer</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>http://www.twitter.com/uncleblazer</a></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/blakeanderson/?hl=en</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm2981935</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>comedy troupes- “Upright Citizens Brigade”, “The Groundlings”; Mail Order Comedy</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Young Hollywood Award for Best Threesome</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>“The Legend of Awesomest Maximus” (2009), “Ratko: The Dictator’s Son” (2009), “Epic” (2013), “Neighbours” (2014), “Dope”(2015), “Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse”</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Workaholic” (2011-),“Community”, “House M.D.”, “Special Delivery”, “Traffic Light”, “Entourage”, “Comedy Bang!Bang!”, “Drunk History”</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Shares the same hometown with Tom Hanks and Dave Brubeck.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Anderson studied with The Groundlings and Upright Citizens Brigade.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>On December 17, 2011, Anderson required surgery after fracturing his spine during a house party by jumping from his roof onto a beer pong table.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Blake went to Clayton Valley High School.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>He was made fun of for his curly hair, so he decided to shave it off because of peer pressure in 1998.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>He attended Orange Coast College and later formed the comedy group Mail Order Comedy with co-stars and co-creators Anders Holm, Adam DeVine, and Kyle Newacheck.
