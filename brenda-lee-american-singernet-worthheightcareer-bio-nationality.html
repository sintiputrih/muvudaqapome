Her father was frequently seeking work between Atlanta and Augusta, therefore she grew up in poverty.

The family did attend local Baptist churches on a regular basis, and she began singing solos every Sunday.</p><p>She earned first place in her school’s talent show contest at the age of five, singing “Take Me Out to the Ball Game.” Lee’s father perished in a construction accident when she was eight years old.

Her big break came in February 1955, when she appeared on “Ozark Jubilee” and sang “Jambalaya.” She agreed to a five-year contract with the show, but she broke it in 1957. Lee joined with Decca Records in 1956 and issued two Christmas singles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hqdefault.jpg><p>Lee re-established herself as a country music performer in the 1970s.
