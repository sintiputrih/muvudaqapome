Explaining that he'd received a "terse email" after returning from the six-week visit, Richard detailed how Leonne had called their time together an "absolute disaster," telling her son, "We only have two things in common, books and classical music."&nbsp;</p><p id=eyDK9U9Lq3p data-wc=24>Nonetheless, Richard concluded the video on a positive note, explaining that most of all he feels "gratitude" towards Leonne, "for having given me life."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/fab298eed1b1-richard-e-grant-black-suit.jpg><p id=eBoxjC3Tz5d data-wc=16>Shortly after posting the video, Richard was inundated with condolences from fans, who praised his candour.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezSVqz1XMLm data-wc=63>"My condolences to you, Richard. I had a similarly complex relationship with my own mother and it's almost like you're grieving twice over - once for the complicated relationship that you had with them, and once for the relationship that you wish you had. As ever, thank you for sharing these most tender of feelings with us. Be kind to yourself," wrote one.&nbsp;</p><p id=eCFlSn2PnYL data-wc=42>"Thank you for your authenticity and transparency and vulnerability," added another. Meanwhile, a third penned: "Very sorry for your loss and very grateful, from the perspective of someone who also weathered a very complicated maternal relationship, for your moving farewell. Take care."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/7c68ac433acd-richard-e-grant-d.jpg><p id=eh0d-dbmC33 data-wc=48>Richard has previously spoken about his difficult childhood in Eswatini (then called Swaziland), with his mother Leonne and father, Henrik Esterhuysen.

And it's continued to be something I've done every day to make sense of the world that I live in."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Stars gone too soon</figure><p id=eV-_Dus4hpH data-wc=79>After Richard's father became aware of his wife's affair, Leonne decided to leave the family, and for a time, she and Richard were estranged. They eventually reconciled, however, after Richard decided to reach out by sending a fax, in which he asked if she could explain why she had had the affair in the first place.
