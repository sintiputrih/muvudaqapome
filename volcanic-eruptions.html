But compared to eruptions throughout world history, it’s practically nothing.</p><p>Almost 26 years to the day after Mount St. Helens’ eruption, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports of seismic activity</a> beneath the volcano imply that the lava is rising again — are we in for another eruption? Perhaps an even more devastating one?</p><p>It’s wouldn’t be the first time a massive volcanic eruption shaped the course of human history — it wouldn’t even be the first time that the same volcano erupted twice in human history.
