This is their story, a chronicle of triumphs and trials, of national championships and nail-biting finishes, of men who molded not just players, but legends.</p><p>Today, we will delve into the strategies and statistics of the last ten coaches who managed the Buckeyes team. We will relive their legacy and experience the glory and heartbreaks.</p><h2 id=ryan-day-2018-2019-present><span class=ez-toc-section id=ryan-day-2018-2019-present></span> Ryan Day (2018, 2019-present)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the illustrious lineage of Ohio State head coaches, Ryan Day (2019-present) stands as a rising star. In just four seasons, he’s amassed a 56-7 record, boasting a 39-3 dominance within the Big Ten. Day’s legacy is already etched with two conference championships (2019, 2020) and bowl victories in the Sugar Bowl (2020) and Rose Bowl (2021).</p><p>When he was handed the head coach duty, he impressed everyone with a 13-1 overall record and won the Big Ten title. As a result, he was awarded the 2019 Big Ten Coach of the Year trophy.</p><p>Day’s meticulous approach emphasizes precision, evident in Justin Fields’ Heisman Trophy finalist campaign (2019) and C.J. Stroud’s 2022 Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year award.</p><h2 id=urban-meyer-2012-2018><span class=ez-toc-section id=urban-meyer-2012-2018></span> Urban Meyer (2012-2018)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Urban Meyer’s tenure at Ohio State wasn’t just successful, it was historic. He compiled a staggering 83-9 record, boasting the program’s highest winning percentage (.902).</p><p>After arriving in Columbus as a legend, carrying national titles with the Florida Gators (2006, 2008), he added third with the Buckeyes in 2014. His first year produces an undefeated 12-0 record. All the seven years under Meyer recorded a 10-win season.</p><p>Meyer’s Buckeyes dominated rivals, most notably Michigan, whom he never lost to in seven seasons. He unearthed Heisman talent in quarterbacks Braxton Miller and J.T. Barrett, while his recruiting prowess brought in generational talents like Joey Bosa and Ezekiel Elliott.</p><h2 id=jim-tressel-2001-2010><span class=ez-toc-section id=jim-tressel-2001-2010></span> Jim Tressel (2001-2010)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before Urban Meyer’s swagger and Ryan Day’s offensive wizardry, Jim Tressel led the Buckeyes with a sweater vest and a “Tresselball” philosophy of discipline and dominance.</p><p>From 2001-2010, he amassed a 94-22 record, including a 56-14 mark in the Big Ten. He led Ohio State to the 2002 national championships, six Big Ten titles (2002, 2005-2009), and five bowl wins (nine appearances).</p><p>The “Holy War” against Michigan was Tressel’s masterpiece. He went 9-1 against the Wolverines, including seven straight wins, restoring balance to the rivalry. Notable moments include the “14-9” shoestring tackle win in 2002 and the 42-7 rout in 2008, cemented by Pryor’s iconic touchdown run.</p><h2 id=john-cooper-1988-2000><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-cooper-1988-2000></span> John Cooper (1988-2000)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>John Cooper inherited a program reeling from scandal. He rebuilt the Buckeyes, brick by brick, into Big Ten contenders. His 113-43-4 record ranks second in Ohio State history, including three Big Ten titles (1993, 1996, 1998).</p><p>Cooper’s offensive schemes produced Heisman finalists Eddie George and Maurice Clarett, along with NFL standouts Orlando Pace and David Givens.&nbsp;</p><p>Individually, Cooper earned Coach of the Year honors in 1986 and 1993 and was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame in 2008. Though his national title quest fell short, Cooper’s legacy is one of dedication, resilience, and laying the foundation for future Buckeye dynasties.</p><h2 id=earle-bruce-1979-1987><span class=ez-toc-section id=earle-bruce-1979-1987></span> Earle Bruce (1979-1987)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Earle Bruce succeeded the legendary Woody Hayes in 1979, inheriting a program hungry for success. He delivered, compiling an 81-26-1 record, and guided the Buckeyes to four Big Ten titles (1979, 191, 1984, 1986) and eight bowl appearances (five wins).</p><p>Bruce’s first season was a heartbreaker, an undefeated regular season culminating in a one-point Rose Bowl loss and a national championship that slipped through their fingers. But his teams remained a force, boasting a stout defense and potent offense featuring Art Schlichter and Anthony Jones.</p><p>He left Ohio State in 1987, still holding the program record for most wins by a non-Woody Hayes coach. His legacy as a fiery leader and champion of his players lives on in the hearts of Buckeye fans, forever etched in the scarlet and gray.</p><h2 id=woody-hayes-1951-1978><span class=ez-toc-section id=woody-hayes-1951-1978></span> Woody Hayes (1951-1978)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Woody Hayes cast a colossal shadow over Ohio State football for 28 seasons. His “Three Yards and a Cloud of Dust” offense pounded out five national championships (1954, 1957, 1961, 1968, 1970) and 205 wins, a program record.</p><p>Beyond the wins, Hayes built rivalries – most notably, “The Game” against Michigan. He went 23-12-1 against the Wolverines, including the infamous “10-10 tie” that sent Ohio State to the Rose Bowl.</p><p>He molded legends like Archie Griffin (two Heisman Trophies) and Rex Kern, guiding Ohio State to four Rose Bowls and 13 Big Ten conference titles.</p><p>From “The Shoe” reverberating with his “three points!” chant to his infamous sideline punch, he embodied the Buckeye spirit.</p><h2 id=wes-fesler-1947-1950><span class=ez-toc-section id=wes-fesler-1947-1950></span> Wes Fesler (1947-1950)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before Woody Hayes, before Jim Tressel, there was Wes Fesler. A three-time All-American player himself (1928, 1929, 1930), Fesler led Ohio State for four seasons, compiling a 21-13-3 record. His tenure wasn’t defined by trophies but by moments of grit and resilience.</p><p>In 1949, Fesler’s Buckeyes shared the Big Ten title and stormed the Rose Bowl, defeating California 17-14. This victory, with its stunning upset and dramatic fourth-quarter comeback, etched Fesler’s name in Ohio State lore. He went on to guide the Buckeyes to two more bowl appearances, cementing his reputation as a fierce competitor.</p><h2 id=paul-bixler-1946><span class=ez-toc-section id=paul-bixler-1946></span> Paul Bixler (1946)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paul Bixler’s lone season at the helm of Ohio State football was a rollercoaster of highs and lows. Inheriting a team brimming with talent post-WWII, Bixler steered the Buckeyes to impressive victories over USC and No. 6 Northwestern.</p><p>However, inconsistent play throughout the season, including a gut-wrenching 58-6 loss to Michigan in Columbus, culminated in a 4-3-2 record and Bixler’s swift departure.</p><p>Despite the brief tenure, Bixler’s season wasn’t without its flashes of brilliance. The shutout of USC marked the first time Ohio State had blanked a West Coast opponent, and the upset of Northwestern showed the team’s potential.</p><h2 id=carroll-widdoes-1944-1945><span class=ez-toc-section id=carroll-widdoes-1944-1945></span> Carroll Widdoes (1944-1945)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While not among the most recognizable names in Ohio State history, Carroll Widdoes left an indelible mark in a mere two seasons.</p><p>His 1944 team, anchored by Heisman Trophy winner Les Horvath, went undefeated, capturing the hearts of wartime America and earning retroactive national titles from two major selectors. He was awarded the 1944 AFCA Coach of the Year.</p><p>Widdoes’ 16-2 record remains the joint second-highest winning percentage (.889) of any Buckeye coach.&nbsp;His undefeated season and two conference titles at Ohio University cemented his place as a coaching legend, both in Ohio and beyond.</p><h2 id=paul-brown-1941-1943><span class=ez-toc-section id=paul-brown-1941-1943></span> Paul Brown (1941-1943)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In just three seasons, Brown etched his name in Buckeye history. His 18-8-1 record may not be the flashiest, but it included a pivotal moment: capturing Ohio State’s first-ever national championship in 1942.</p><p>Brown’s impact went beyond wins. He revolutionized the game, introducing the “West Coast Offense” and modernizing practice methods. His innovative single-wing offense, with its emphasis on passing and ball control, propelled the Buckeyes to two top-five finishes and the No. 1 status in 1942.</p><p>Brown went on to become the founder and first coach of the Cleveland Browns, solidifying his place as a pioneer of professional football. While his time at Ohio State was brief, his impact on the program’s identity and future success is undeniable.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKSRqMFufY9mpqGhn2LAta3TnmSfp5%2Bpr6K4y2aaqJmTnbK0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
