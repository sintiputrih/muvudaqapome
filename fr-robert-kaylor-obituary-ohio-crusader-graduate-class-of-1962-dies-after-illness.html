Robert Kaylor Obituary, Death –&nbsp;</strong>The Reverend Fr. Robert Kaylor, principal of Central Catholic High School, lost his fight with illness and passed away recently. After a protracted battle with illness, Reverend Robert Kaylor passed away on Friday night, November 10.</p><p>His funeral was on Saturday. On the Friends of Canton Central Catholic Facebook page, an announcement was made regarding his passing. We are deeply saddened to inform you, Crusader family, of the demise of our much loved Reverend Robert Kaylor. According to his family, the note stated that he died peacefully while sleeping on Friday, November 10, and that this information was confirmed by his relatives.</p><p>The Reverend Father Kaylor served as the previous principal of Central Catholic High School. A graduate of the Crusader class of 1962, Fr. Kaylor dedicated over four decades of his life to serving the Crusader family and the greater community in various capacities, including as a priest, educator, president, civic leader, and friend. He never stopped praying for his neighbourhood, he never stopped fighting for his children and his employees, and he never stopped cheering them on from the sidelines.</p><p>He exemplified everything that it meant to be a crusader in its purest form. Because of his dedication to Central Catholic High School, the lives of a significant number of the school’s faculty members, staff members, administrators, and students have been profoundly altered. His legacy will live on in each person who has walked through our halls in the past and will walk through them in the future.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwstFmqaialafBbrfAsqOoql2kr6rA1JqpsmWfnbawecKrrKyZlJq%2FbrPRmpuumaSaeqS4wKyqZqeWYn56gpFmm6Kdo2Kup8DEq2SipJyjsrS%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
