The Warner Bros. film, out June 16, features <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ezra Miller</a>&nbsp;</strong>as the titular character. And for a while, the film’s fate was up in the air due to<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> controversy surrounding Ezra</a>. The 30-year-old actor (who uses they/them pronouns) has been arrested several times, and they were charged with burglary into an occupied home and petit larceny in Vermont. After announcing they were seeking treatment for “complex mental health issues,” Ezra <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pleaded guilty</a> to the unlawful trespassing charges and took a plea deal that involves one year of probation. Before accepting the plea deal, Ezra could’ve been subjected to up to 25 years in prison.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Ezra’s legal troubles, which have died down immensely in the last year, almost caused trouble for the release of <i>The Flash</i>, but the film is still coming out as scheduled. Ezra <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attended the film’s LA premiere</a> on June 12 and issued his first public comments since the allegations. Before the premiere, director <strong>Andy Muschietti&nbsp;</strong>said that he <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wouldn’t recast Ezra</a> if there is a sequel film.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Most recently, on Jun. 30, 2023, they took to Instagram <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in response</a> to the temporary&nbsp;harassment prevention order put against him expired. “I’m encouraged by today’s outcome and very grateful at this moment to everyone who has stood by me and sought to ensure this egregious misuses of the protective order system was halted,” they began in the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>social media post</a>. “Protective orders are meant to provide safety for individuals, families and children who are in danger. They are not meant to be used as weapons by those seeking attention or fleeting tabloid fame or some sort of personal vengeance when there are people in true and dire need of these services.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>They also noted that they felt they were treated “unjustly” in the matter. “I have been unjustly and directly targeted by an individual who the facts have shown has a history of such manipulative and destructive actions,” Ezra went on. “I implored those members of the media who have recklessly spread false claims and failed to accurately report the truth and content of this story, to hold themselves to a high standard and take the time to find the facts, rather than chasing the clicks.” The full statement can be seen above.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Amid Ezra’s latest statement, below, <strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>has rounded up everything you need to know about their alleged crimes and controversies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ezra-miller-as-the-flash-warner-bros-ec-embed1-1.jpg><h2>What Is Ezra Miller Famous For?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Ezra Miller was born in New Jersey and dropped out of high school to pursue an acting career. Their first movie was the 2008 drama film&nbsp;Afterschool. Ezra followed that up with the movies&nbsp;We Need to Talk About Kevin,&nbsp;The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and&nbsp;Trainwreck. The actor played Credence Barebone/Aurelius Dumbledore in Disney’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fantastic Beasts</a>&nbsp;franchise. Ezra’s most notable television role was the CBS miniseries&nbsp;The Stand. They also appeared in episodes of&nbsp;Royal Pains&nbsp;on USA Network.</p><h2>Ezra Miller Arrested</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>The very first time that Ezra was arrested was in June 2011 when they were filming&nbsp;Perks of Being a Wallflower. Ezra was reportedly a passenger in a vehicle pulled over for a broken brake light in Pittsburg. Authorities discovered that Ezra allegedly had marijuana in their possession and charged the actor with drug possession. But the charges were eventually dropped and Ezra paid a $600 penalty, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BuzzFeed News.&nbsp;</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ezra-miller-as-the-flash-ss-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>Ezra was arrested two more times in March and April 2022.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first arrest occurred on March 28</a>&nbsp;after an alleged physical altercation ensued between Ezra and other people at a karaoke bar in Hawaii. Ezra was charged with disorderly conduct and harassment. On April 19, Ezra was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>arrested again</a>&nbsp;in Hawaii on suspicion of assault after allegedly throwing a chair at a 26-year-old woman. They pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct and was ordered to pay a $500 fine. In a plea deal, prosecutors dropped the harassment charge and an unrelated traffic charge.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>In June 2022, Ezra was accused of harassing a 12-year-old child,&nbsp;<strong>Tokata “Gibson” Iron Eyes</strong>. The child’s parents filed a temporary harassment prevention order for Gibson and Gibson’s mother against Ezra in Massachusetts, which was granted. In court documents, the parents said, “Ezra uses violence, intimidation, threat of violence, fear, paranoia, delusions and drugs to hold sway over a young adolescent Tokata Ezra has brainwashed Tokata. Ezra Miller has ensured that Tokata is without a phone and has given her bankcard to another of his workers.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>But Tokata/Gibson denied their parents’ allegations against Ezra. “My father and his allegations hold no weight and are frankly transphobic and based in the notion that I am somehow incapable of coherent thought or opposing opinions to those of my own kindred worrying about my well being,” the child said in a statement on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “I am now aware of the severity of emotional and psychological manipulation I was made to endure while in my parents home.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ezra-miller-as-the-flash-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>Ezra was also arrested on August 7, 2022. The actor was charged with felony burglary after allegedly stealing bottles of alcohol from a home three months earlier in Stamford, Vermont on May 1, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CNN.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>On Monday, August 15, Ezra provided a statement to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>, saying that they are seeking “ongoing” treatment. “Having recently gone through a time of intense crisis, I now understand that I am suffering complex mental health issues and have begun ongoing treatment,” Ezra told the publication. “I want to apologize to everyone that I have alarmed and upset with my past behavior. I am committed to doing the necessary work to get back to a healthy, safe and productive stage in my life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>On October 17, Ezra pleaded not guilty to the burglary and petit larceny charges. The actor was facing 26 years in prison if they were convicted on both of the charges. According to Variety, the petit larceny charges stated that the items Ezra stole were worth less than $900. That charge was a maximum of one year in prison and a $1,000 maximum fine, while the burglary charge was a maximum of 25 years in prison and a $1,000 maximum fine.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Ezra’s attorney <strong>Lisa B. Shelkrot&nbsp;</strong>said in a statement, “Ezra Miller this morning pled not guilty to one count of burglary and one count of petit larceny in Vermont Superior Court and accepted the court-imposed conditions of not contacting or entering the home of the inhabitants. Ezra would like to acknowledge the love and support they have received from their family and friends, who continue to be a vital presence in their ongoing mental health.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>On January 13, 2023, Ezra accepted a plea deal for their Vermont unlawful trespassing charges. In exchange for pleading guilty, Ezra was given a $500 fine and sentenced to a year of probation. “Ezra Miller pled guilty this morning to a misdemeanor unlawful trespass in Vermont Superior Court and accepted the conditions imposed by the court. Ezra would like to thank the court and the community for their trust and patience throughout this process, and would once again like to acknowledge the love and support they have received from their family and friends, who continue to be a vital presence in their ongoing mental health,” their lawyer said in a statement to Variety.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>In April 2023, director Andy Muschietti broke his silence on Ezra’s troubles at a screening and Q&A for the film. “Ezra is well now,” Andy said, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Weekly</a>. “We’re all hoping that they get better… They’re taking the steps to recovery,” Andy added. “They’re dealing with mental health issues, but they’re well. We talked to them not too long ago, and they’re very committed to getting better.”</p><h2>Ezra Miller as ‘The Flash’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ezra-Miller-Crimes-Controversies-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-20>Ezra made their film debut as Barry Allen/The Flash in 2016’s&nbsp;Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. They had just a brief appearance in that movie, as well as&nbsp;Suicide Squad&nbsp;which came out that same year. They had a major role in 2017’s&nbsp;Justice League, alongside<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Ben Affleck</strong></a> as Batman, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Henry Cavill</strong></a> as Superman, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gal Gadot</strong></a> as Wonder Woman, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jason Momoa</strong></a> as Aquaman, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ray Fisher</strong></a> as Cyborg. Ezra was also featured in 2021’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Zac Snyder’s Justice League</a>, which was original director <strong>Zac Snyder</strong>‘s cut of the film. Ezra also made a cameo appearance in the season finale of HBO Max’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Peacemaker</a>&nbsp;starring <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>John Cena</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>The Flash&nbsp;is Ezra’s first standalone movie in the DCEU. The film was officially announced by Warner Bros and DC Films back in October 2014, though it took years for the planning and pre-production stages.&nbsp;Andy Muschietti signed on as director in November 2019. The official description for the movie reads, “Barry travels back in time to prevent his mother’s murder, which brings unintended consequences.”</p><h2>Is ‘The Flash’ Release Cancelled?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-22><i>The Flash </i>will arrive in theaters on June 16, 2023. After Ezra’s first arrest in March 2022, Warner Bros. and DC executives held an “emergency impromptu meeting” to discuss the actor’s future with the studio, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a> reported. According to a source, the “consensus in the room was to hit pause on any future projects involving Miller including possible appearances in the DC Extended Universe.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ezra-miller-as-the-flash-warner-bros-ec-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>In June 2022, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a> reported that the studio had “tried getting help” for Ezra. “There is no winning in this for Warner Bros,” a studio source told the outlet. “This is an inherited problem for Zaslav. The hope is that the scandal will remain at a low level before the movie is released, and hope for the best to turn out.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>After Ezra’s felony burglary arrest in August 2022, Warner Bros. reportedly came up with three possible scenarios that could have played out in regards to Ezra and The Flash, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. A source close to the studio detailed these three scenarios to the outlet. The first was that if Ezra seeked professional help, the actor could give an interview to explain their “erratic behavior over the past few years.” This scenario was also planned to involve Ezra doing limited press to promote <i>The Flash</i>. In the second scenario, where Ezra didn’t seek help, The Flash&nbsp;would still be released as planned but Ezra wouldn’t be involved in the marketing or publicity. The role of Barry Allen/The Flash would also be recast for future DC projects. The third scenario involved the situation with Ezra getting worse. If that happened, the studio would’ve scrapped The Flash&nbsp;entirely despite it costing $200 million to create.</p><p id=content-paragraph-24>On August 24, Ezra had a damage control meeting on the Warner Bros. Burbank lot with their CAA agent, <strong>Scott Metzger</strong>, and the WB’s new film chairs <strong>Michael De Luca </strong>and <strong>Pam Abdy</strong>, according to The Hollywood Reporter.&nbsp;The conference was for Ezra and Scott to lay down a plan on how to keep on track for The Flash’s release date — but, moreover, to give the higher ups confidence that Ezra is committed to the movie and is remorseful for the negative press, per the outlet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>Ultimately, Ezra stopped getting into legal trouble in 2022, and things calmed down. That allowed Warner Bros. to move forward with&nbsp;The Flash, and the studio has <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>released</a> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>several trailers</a> for the film ahead of its June 16 release. On June 3, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>&nbsp;reported that Ezra will “make a low-profile appearance” at the film’s Los Angeles premiere on June 12, but the actor will only be posing for photos, and won’t speak to reporters. “Ezra wants the movie to open and the conversation to be about the movie and not about Ezra,” a source close to Ezra told Variety. “They are focused on their mental health and don’t want it to be transactional.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ezra-Miller-Crimes-Controversies-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-26>Ezra did indeed show up to&nbsp;The Flash premiere in LA on June 12. He took pictures on the red carpet with the film’s cast and crew in his first public appearance since the controversies. After the red carpet, the cast and crew moved to inside Grauman’s Chinese Theatre, where Ezra made a rare public speech, according to Deadline.&nbsp;The actor thanked Warner Bros. Discovery CEO <strong>David Zaslav</strong>, Warner Bros. Film Group heads <strong>Michael De Luca</strong> and <strong>Pam Abdy</strong> and DC Studios heads <strong>James Gunn</strong> and <strong>Peter Safran </strong>for “your grace and discernment and care in the context of my life. And in bringing this moment to fruition.” He also thanked director Andy Muschietti, saying, “I love you, maestro.
