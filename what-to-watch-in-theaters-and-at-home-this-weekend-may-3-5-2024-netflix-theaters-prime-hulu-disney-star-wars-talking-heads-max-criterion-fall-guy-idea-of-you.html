As a friendly reminder, Mother's Day is May 12 in the USA and is fast approaching. I'll try to put up some gift options this weekend (but a Star Wars guide for May the 4th will come first).</p><p>If you're thinking of heading out to theaters, your new option is <a href=# title=https://thenationaldesk.com/news/from-the-desk/the-fall-guy-05-02-2024-ryan-gosling-emily-blunt-aaron-taylor-johnson-teresa-palmer-stuntman-movie-review# class=themeColorForLinks>"The Fall Guy,"</a> a fantastic action film with a bit of humor and romance from "Deadpool 2" director David Leitch. The film stars Ryan Gosling as a stuntman tangled up in an unfolding mystery. It's mostly just crazy stunts with bits of plot to connect them. It might be the most fun you have in a movie theater this year.</p><p>Seeing as it is the start of the month, there is a surplus of titles available to stream. If you are looking for a by-the-numbers romantic drama you'll probably enjoy Anne Hathaway in "The Idea of You." I found the film to be too conventional. The main hook of the film is that the story sees an older woman romanced by a young and massively famous pop star. Is this what Coachella has devolved into? Or is this a warning sent to us from the future? I love Hathaway. Were I to make a list of people I’d love to work with, she’d be in my top 10. I tried to like “The Idea of You,” and there are some interesting moments in the final act and a lot of good intentions, but it never worked for me. It checked off all the boxes and there was cheering from the audience at the end. Maybe you’ll like it?</p><p>Saturday is Star Wars Day and to celebrate Disney+ has released “Star Wars: Tales of the Empire.” We’re given two three-part stories. Each chapter is around 15 minutes. Both narratives give back stories to secondary characters from the Star Wars Universe. In this case, those characters are Morgan Elsbeth and Barriss Offee. You don’t need to be a Star Wars expert to follow the stories, but some of their significance may be lost if you aren’t familiar with the Disney+ series “Ahsoka” for Elsbeth and the fifth season of “The Clone Wars” for Offee. I hope Star Wars isn’t going too far into the weeds for the casual fan.</p><p>If you’re in the mood for music, “Stop Making Sense,” Jonathan Demme’s acclaimed Talking Heads concert film is making its way to Max.</p><p>Here are the trailers and synopsizes for those four films and more than 20 additional titles making their streaming debuts this weekend.</p><h2>The Fall Guy (Theaters)</h2><p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> He’s a stuntman, and like everyone in the stunt community, he gets blown up, shot, crashed, thrown through windows and dropped from the highest of heights, all for our entertainment.
