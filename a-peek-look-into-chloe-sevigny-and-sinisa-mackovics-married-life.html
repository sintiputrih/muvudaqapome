This past weekend, two years after their wedding, Makovi hosted a gathering for their family and friends.</h3><p>Makovi shared an Instagram Story photo of the couple taking a selfie on Sunday. Their 2-year-old son Vanja was dressed for the wedding in the third image, which also had a “JUST MARRIED” banner fastened to the rear of the car.</p><p>Magazine editor Olivier Zahm posted a picture of the couple greeting their visitors from their car. At their recent wedding, Makovi wore a conventional black suit while Sevigny alternated between a number of white dresses throughout the day.</p><p>Sinia Makovi, the woman who is married to Chlo Sevigny, was born on August 21, 1981, in Zagreb, Croatia. He runs the Karma Art Gallery in New York City and is an artist. His LinkedIn profile states that he has been in the position since 2011.</p><p>His gallery also participated in the illustrious Miami Art Basel Fair last year, when works like Woody De Othello, Henni Alftan, and Alex De Corte were priced between $10,000 and $200,000. Despite certain well-known figures visiting his museum, Sinia keeps a low profile.</p><p>His Instagram page doesn’t have any recent pictures of him. His family, employment history, and educational background are still unknown. As the husband of Chlo Sevigny, he gained notoriety. They welcomed a boy, Vanja Sevigny Makovi, on May 2, 2020.</p><h2>Relationship between Chlo Sevigny and Sinia Makovi</h2><p>Sinia Makovi and Chlo Sevigny began dating in 2018. Sevigny announced their marriage on Instagram in March 2021 after their March 2020 nuptials.</p><p>A little more than two months before their son Vanja was born, they were married. They just just announced their upcoming nuptials.</p><p>In January 2020, Chlo made her pregnancy known, and her agent confirmed the information. Additionally, in October 2020, the American Horror Story actor appeared on the cover of Playgirl’s latest print magazine for a 21-photo spread taken before Vanja was born. When questioned about her pregnancy, Sevigny responded,</p><p>In my early 40s, when it didn’t, I thought, “I have to kind of actively attempt and make this happen.” It was just something that was supposed to happen.</p><p>After a night of drinking and dancing, we returned home. Then, something I had previously battled with just happened and stayed. I then reflected, “Wow, this one really wants to be here.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>A Look At The Success And Relationships Of Joan- Baez</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Model</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jagnoor Aneja</a></h3>Jagnoor Aneja was a fashion choreographer, reality show star, model trainer, influencer, and television personality from Delhi, India (born March 13, 1992 [Age: 29 years] - passed away September 23, 2 <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Saba Qamar</a></h3>Saba Qamar estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
