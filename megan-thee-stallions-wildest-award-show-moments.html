That was the night that Canadian rapper <a href=#>Tory Lanez</a> allegedly shot her foot while they were in the Hollywood Hills. As reported by <a href=#>TMZ</a>, the rappers got into an altercation inside an SUV after attending a house party, "someone fired shots in the air," Lanez was arrested, and Meg was taken to the hospital.&nbsp;As of July 2021, the case has yet to be resolved legally, but <a href=#>Megan was granted a restraining order against Lanez</a>.</p><p>As <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> noted, Megan Thee Stallion appeared in public for the first time since the shooting at the MTV Video Music Awards on August 30, 2020. She won the Best Hip Hop&nbsp;Video for "Savage," and like many other winners that night, she accepted the trophy virtually. Oh, and she had quite the prop too â€” and we're not talking about the Moon&nbsp;Person statuette.&nbsp;</p><p>For her<a href=#>&nbsp;acceptance speech video,</a>&nbsp;Megan had a pink bottle of champagne in hand. At one point, she popped the cork, which officially made the speech one of her wild award show moments.&nbsp;"This is my second moon man, definitely not my last," she said after giggling a bit. The "Suga" creator then poured out some of the bubbly while telling viewers that "We're going to keep turning up." It was a true rockstar moment for Megan and it also showed how resilient she is, considering the harrowing incident that she was involved in just weeks prior.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW9jbn11e8yenpqmXam1prGMrKuapJyevK%2B%2FjLCgpZyVqMFurdaaqZ1lo528uHnMqKSepqSofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
