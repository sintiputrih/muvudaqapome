They just gave what may be their first in-person interview as an <a href=#>engaged couple</a> as an exclusive to an unofficial theme-park fan vlog called <a href=#>Chip and Company</a>. In the bizarre video, the <a href=#>NFL player–slash–Jeopardy! host</a> and the actress-slash-person sit with empty Mickey Mouse mugs in the middle of a Disney World hotel lobby like bored kids “playing TV host” while Mom and Dad fight at the check-in desk. Woodley is wearing Minnie Mouse ears on top of a hat that says “DOG DAD,” while Rodgers is in a Star Wars shirt and cargo shorts. Distressing. When asked about her favorite park, Woodley says “my parents loved Epcot because” and mimes a drinking motion. Upsetting. When asked what makes them proud of each other (come through, Disney mommy vlogger with the offbeat questions), Woodley strokes Rodgers’s knee and says, “I’m really proud, baby, of how you make the bed in the morning. You’re really good at it.” Rodgers out-weirds her by saying, “And I’m really proud of your diligence with brushing your teeth.” Are they reading off of cue cards auto-generated by a malfunctioning <a href=#>Carousel of Progress animatronic</a>?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckngia2py001m3h6f4jkcsk8w@published data-word-count=105>The part of the video that made us most question our reality is when the interviewer asks what their favorite Disney movies to watch on repeat are, and Woodley immediately says <a href=#>Avatar</a>. As in, the James Cameron film that technically became Disney IP after the <a href=#>21st Century Fox acquisition</a>. It all just seems too suspicious to be real, but it’s also not an official Disney interview so it couldn’t have been canned for promotional reasons, could it? What’s the ulterior motive here? Shailene, if you’re campaigning to play Anna and Elsa’s long-lost third sister, Dorinda, in Frozen 3, there’s got to be a better way.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cknoy6w6c000r3h6gahkz8y4w@published data-word-count=66><strong>Update, April 19 at 2:45 p.m. ET: </strong>It appears that Woodley and Rodgers’s Disney World interview wasn’t a Chip and Company exclusive after all. According to a source that reached out to Vulture, this video was initially an unlisted official Disney Parks post and was leaked by Chip and Company before its scheduled release date. Today, the video was posted to the official Disney Parks Blog.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cklhmig8p0000ceom4g0urkb8@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Quar Goss Confirmed: Shailene Woodley Is, in Fact, Engaged to Aaron Rodgers</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Shailene Woodley and Aaron Rodgers Are Disney Vloggers Now</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpamdgaXy0tMCio56mlWLEsLvDpZyyZZGjsW6twKump2WipLGosdGsZJ2ho6OyunnIp6ueqqaesrh51aKbnqdencGuuA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
