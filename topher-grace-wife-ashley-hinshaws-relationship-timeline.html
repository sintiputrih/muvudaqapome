Weeks before tying the knot, Hinshaw shared a glimpse of her bridal shower celebrations via social media.</p><p>“Surrounded by ❤️ and 😂 yesterday. Couldn’t ask for anything more,” she captioned an April 2016 Instagram upload.</p><p>Shortly after their intimate wedding ceremony, the bride gushed over newlywed life with Grace. “It’s crazy! I mean, it’s good. It’s actually a little bit more different than I thought it would be,” she told Us Weekly in July 2016. “Because we lived together beforehand, so I didn’t really think that anything was going to change, but it does. It feels a little extra special.”</p><p>The <a href=#>That ’70s Show</a> alum and the Indiana native <a href=#>rarely post photos</a> of one another online, but their fans have followed along as the pair’s family has grown. <a href=#>Hinshaw revealed her first pregnancy in August 2017</a>, sharing a radiant selfie that kept her baby bump concealed.</p><p>“When you’re 6 1/2 months pregnant and someone else does your hair/makeup/wardrobe and makes you feel like a princess ? for the first time in a whiiiiile ??” she teased in the caption.</p><p>The About Cherry star gave birth three months later. While walking the <a href=#>2019 Golden Globes</a> red carpet, the twosome joked about briefly <a href=#>ditching the responsibilities of parenthood</a>. “We’re doing everything!” Grace teased to Us at the awards show. “We got a babysitter tonight.”</p><p>When asked about the biggest piece of advice he’d share with expectant parents, the Valentine’s Day actor answered: “Get some sleep now and save it for [when the baby’s here].”</p><p>One year later, the model revealed she was <a href=#>pregnant with baby No. 2</a>, exclusively telling Us that she was “nervous” and “excited” about expanding her family. Us broke the news in August 2020 that <a href=#>Hinshaw gave birth</a>, but the couple has yet to reveal the little one’s name.</p><p>Grace <a href=#>announced on The Kelly Clarkson Show</a> in October 2022 that he and the LOL actress had baby No. 3 on the way. Despite their busy routines as parents, the twosome always tries to make time for one another.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Wine and Netflix,” Hinshaw told Us in January 2019 about how she and Grace do date night at home. “We try to get some sleep when we have a babysitter, so we go to bed at 9. It’s fun stuff at the Grace household. Very exciting stuff.”</p><p>Scroll down for a closer look at Grace and Hinshaw’s love story:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwbC8x56pZp%2BilrCmedainZ5lkai1rbHYZp%2BipqOdrri%2FjKucpZmknryvv8eip2asmaKyrbXNnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
