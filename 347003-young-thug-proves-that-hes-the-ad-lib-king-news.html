In fact, some artists have gone so far as to develop signature ad-libs, which have&nbsp;in some cases become more memorable than the bars. While that's not exactly the case for modern rap legend <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Thug</a>, it's clear that the versatile YSL artist has mastered the ad-lib down to a science, a fact confirmed by a telling-behind the scenes video from a recent studio session.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/82/63/356382_db0f9e63cd6ea38998d53c4e966a0a0b.jpg><p><h6>&nbsp;Andrew Chin/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the clip, shared by Our Generation Music, Thugger can be seen chiming in with a helpful suggestion, one that further validates his position as the ad-lib king. "If you give me one of your songs, a full song," he begins, standing up to address the room. "A full song. If I put ad-libs on the song, I'ma put ad-libs where you--you wouldn't know it should have been ad-libs there, but it sounds so perfect."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Clearly, Thugger understands that his mind works in mysterious ways -- ways that just so happen to understand the science of ad-lib placement more effectively than most. To confirm that Thug isn't simply all-talk, Zoey Dollaz slid through to share some first-hand experience. "Crazy cus I got a song I was recording he walked in the studio and said let me do ur Adlibs," explains Dollaz. "Ni*ga sat down recorded himself and did the adlibs on there." It would seem that Thug not only wants to do them, but&nbsp;needs&nbsp;to. And why wouldn't he? When one has a gift, one tends to enjoy using it whenever the occasion demands it.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Feature Editor&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Mitch Findlay is a writer and hip-hop journalist based in Montreal.
