The former reality star posed for snaps in red-and-black lingerie paired with a matching robe.</p><p>“#happyvalentinesday,” Montag captioned an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram Reels video</a> featuring the photos. The shoot also included some snaps where she posed in the bathtub with a drink. Montag teased the sultry images one day prior.</p><p>“Valentine’s Day shoot coming,” she captioned a selfie video from Tuesday, February 13.</p><p>On Valentine’s Day, Pratt, 40, responded to the photo shoot by sharing the snaps via Instagram Stories alongside a series of heart-eye emojis.</p><p>“I enjoy Valentine’s Day more if I financially have money,” Pratt said during the Valentine’s Day episode of the couple’s <a href=# rel=noopener>“Speidi’s 16th Minute” podcast</a>, which was released on Wednesday. “That is when it’s cool because I enjoy buying really nice gifts.”</p><p>Montag responded, “Flowers always go a million miles. You always do that.”</p><p>Pratt told his wife that when he’s gotten her flowers in the past “it was not worth the payoff,” but Montag disagreed.</p><p>“Yes, it was, I look at them all the time,” she continued. “Maybe I don’t have as much time to sit there. … You shouldn’t have an expectation about it because it means more than, obviously, I’m conveying.”</p><p>Their official podcast account later confirmed that Pratt “came thru” with roses for Montag by sharing a photo of the bouquet.</p><p>Montag and Pratt have been together since their days on <a href=#>The Hills</a>, the MTV reality show that premiered in 2006. The beginning of their relationship and eventual marriage were documented throughout the series, which came to an end in 2010.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple got married onscreen in 2008 before having a second ceremony the following year. They’ve since expanded their family, welcoming two sons: Gunnar in October 2017 and <a href=#>Ryker in November 2022</a>.</p><p>Montag has detailed her health journey as a mother of two by <a href=#>partnering with Hydroxycut</a>.</p><p>“It’s also great to set that example for your kids and to show them, like, ‘Mom eats healthy. Dad eats healthy, let’s all eat healthy together,’” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>Us Weekly</a> exclusively last month. “My mom says I have the healthiest kids of anyone she’s seen. I do try to [get] the healthiest foods for them. I obviously don’t want to deprive them of being children, so it’s all about balance for them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahp6ditaa1w6Jkpqeeqa6oecCnm2aroJq7pLHRZqermaSpeqSxy56Zq5mkmrFuwsClnKesmaOytHnDmrBmamBngXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
