And she was like, 'No.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5cf42688498f-gettyimages-1916815057.jpg><p id=eVC17gqG0MZc data-wc=59>Emily then revealed that their accent changed once again when their daughters were being educated in London during the COVID-19 pandemic. Emily at the time had finished filming , and she told Jimmy Kimmel: "My little one sent me a video of her singing 'Jingle Bells,' and she goes, 'Jingle ol' da way!' Almost like a Cockney.</p><p id=eAGM_iCFQ2U data-wc=20>"It was almost like Dick Van Dyke singing 'Jingle Bells' with the craziest accent ever.
