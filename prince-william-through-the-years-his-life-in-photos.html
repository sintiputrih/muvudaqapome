Their second child, son <a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a>, arrived in September 1984. However, the brothers suffered two childhood tragedies: first, their parents’ divorce in August 1996 and then, <a href=#>their mother’s death</a> in August 1997.</p><p>William has been open about the aftermath of his mother’s untimely death in the years since the loss. “I think when you are bereaved at a very young age, anytime really, but particularly at a young age — I can resonate closely to that — you <a href=#>feel pain like no other pain</a>,” he explained during BBC’s A Royal Team Talk: Tackling Mental Health in 2019. “And you know that in your life it’s going to be very difficult to come across something that is going to be an even worse pain than that.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Duke of Cambridge and Harry leaned on each other</a>, and William attempted to carry on with his life amid his grief. He eventually met his future wife, <a href=#><strong>Princess Kate</strong></a>, while attending college in Scotland. The country holds a special significance for him because it is the <a href=#>same place where he spent time with family after Diana’s death</a>.</p><p><a href=#>William and Kate married</a> in April 2011. Prior to their enviable royal wedding, they shared rare details about their relationship in their 2010 engagement interview. “Obviously we both have a very fun time together, both have a very good sense of humor about things, we’re down to earth, we take the mickey out of each other a lot, and she’s got plenty of habits that make me laugh that I tease her about,” he gushed.</p><p>The Duchess of Cambridge, for her part, raved, “Over the years, William has looked after me, he’s treated me very well — as the loving boyfriend he is, he is very supportive of me through the good times and also through the bad times.”</p><p>The couple went on to have three children: <a href=#>Prince George</a> in July 2013, <a href=#>Princess Charlotte</a> in May 2015 and <a href=#>Prince Louis</a> in April 2018.</p><p>William <a href=#>got real about adjusting to fatherhood</a> in November 2016. “It’s been quite a change for me personally. I’m very lucky in the support I have from Catherine. She’s an amazing mother and a fantastic wife,” he said on Talk Vietnam. “I’ve struggled at times. The alteration from being a single, independent man to going into marriage and then having children is life-changing.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He and his family were all in attendance at <a href=#>Charles’ coronation</a> in May 2023.
