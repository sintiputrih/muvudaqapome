This former Navarro cheerleader returned to the team as their new assistant coach, and right at the start, she’s got herself into some beef with her former teammate/then student La’Darius Marshall.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Keep reading this Kailee Peppers Bio to learn more about her.</span></p><h3><b>Kailee Peppers On Netflix’s Cheer Season 2</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kailee Peppers was invited to Navarro as their new assistant coach because the head coach Monica Aldama had to leave the team to compete on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Dancing With the Stars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2020.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, as the new assistant coach Kailee and Andy Cosferent started the season well. Unfortunately, not long after Kailee and the fan-favorite La’Darius Marshall got into a drama over a dog.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Reportedly, La’Darius adopted two dogs and gave one to Kailee to keep watch until the end of the semester. But Kailee thought the dog was hers to keep, which resulted in a scuffle! Sadly, this also ultimately led to La’Darius abruptly leaving the show partway through the season.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to La’Darius, he wasn’t getting the support he needed from the coaching staff while Monica was gone. And apparently, it didn’t get any better after the head coach returned as well.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Kailee, she didn’t respond to the matter. However, she did talk about her time on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Cheer</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and mentioned she had “so much fun being a part of this season with all of my favorite people and the amazing film crew.”</span></p><h3><b>Kailee Peppers Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kailee Peppers was born on July 2, 1996. That made her 25 years of age when she first appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Cheer</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Corresponding to her birthday, Kailee is of the Cancer zodiac.</span></p><h3><b>Does Kailee Peppers Have A Boyfriend?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kailee Peppers was once rumored to be dating the Navarro cheerleader Matthew David. But the star herself never confirmed that he was her boyfriend. The two appeared to be together since 2016, and the last we saw them over Kailee IG was in April 2019 post captioned, “One last time with my people.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, back in 2016, when the two were supposedly in love. Kailee did make some lovey-dovey tweets such as — “Just wish I could see my boyfriend every day; or I’m obsessed with my boyfriend.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Then fast forward to Feb 2019, Kailee went on to reveal that her boyfriend was the first person to ever not tip her. “He said, ‘you didn’t introduce yourself,’” she recalled.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Kailee’s dating life before 2016, it didn’t seem like she was in any serious relationship before that. “I just want a cute tall boyfriend who’s not annoying is that too much to ask for,” she once tweeted in 2013.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=font-weight:400> Kailee once believed that she’ll never have a boyfriend.</span></p><h3><b>Kailee Peppers Height</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kailee Peppers stands tall at a height of 5 feet 5 inches (165 cm).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mentioning her distinct features, she has hazel eyes, dark straight hair, and a triangular face.</span></p><h3><b>Kailee Peppers Career</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kailee Peppers was a cheerleader for as long as she can remember.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Having cheered since she was a little girl, Kailee was quick to realize that she wanted to pursue a career in the industry. So, she enrolled herself at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Navarro College</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and moved to Corsicana, Texas. There, she was coached by the renowned Coach Monica Aldama for three years, during which she also competed for the team during their 2015 to 2017 seasons.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In her third year, Kailee was even offered the position of Navarro’s first-ever Assistant Cheer Coach for the 2017-18 season. But she wasn’t just ready to be on the sidelines yet. Thus, she went on to cheer for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Texas Tech University</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> for the next two years and finally returned to coaching, alongside Andy Cosferent in </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Cheer</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> season 2.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, what is she doing now? Well after </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Cheer</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> came to an end, Kailee left Navarro once again and joined the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Texas Tech University</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> cheerleading squad, also going back to the co-ed program for her third year.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Despite being a coach, she’s still practicing hard because cheer is much more than a passion to her. We have no idea what’s her next plan, but one thing for sure — We’ll be seeing more of her on the TV.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Where Is Kailee Peppers From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>She hails from Columbus, Ohio.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Has Kailee Peppers Revealed Her Family?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kailee Peppers was born to interracial parents, Aimee and Richie Peppers.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her father, Richie is a </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Groveport Madison High School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> graduate who went on to become a branch manager of Inlanta Mortgage, Inc.</span></p><p>We have no information on her mother.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for her siblings, she has a sister named Kierstyn and a brother named Tristan Peppers (a </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Pickerington High School Central</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> athlete).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unfortunately, her aunt Jennifer Rae Zimmerman passed away in an automobile accident on July 30, 2007, at the age of 28.</span></p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Kailee Peppers On IG?</strong></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>kailee.peppers</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, her’s her Facebook @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>kailee.peppers</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, Twitter @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>kaixopepp</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, and TikTok @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>kaixopepp</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpJmZobKmec%2Bep6mdoqh6o7XOZpignV2XvLqy0aKcp5xdnbKqs8etZJyglZq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
