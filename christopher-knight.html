Most importantly, acknowledge yourself for who you are and if you’re struggling with anything resembling ADD get professionally diagnosed.”&nbsp;<strong>– Christopher Knight</strong></p><p>“One of the hardest aspects of this protracted public persona is not knowing others as well as they feel they know me. It’s a rather clumsy feeling actually; to not know someone who acts as though you’re old friends.”&nbsp;<strong>– Christopher Knight</strong></p><p>“Television is much better crafted today than in the 70s. The content is less positive, but I’m one of those that feel our entertainment reflects our world, it’s not a driver – art imitates life.”&nbsp;<strong>– Christopher Knight</strong></p><p>“The Brady Bunch is a live-action modern fairytale of family. In this context, it’s less odd that it’s lasted for over thirty years, and why it may last in some respects as long as Mother Goose!”&nbsp;<strong>– Christopher Knight</strong></p><p>“It’s an honor to have been part of something so core to so many lives. The show has evolved beyond its original intent and form and has transcended… itself!”&nbsp;<strong>– Christopher Knight</strong></p><p>“With no audience, no one to perform for, I was just there. There was no need to define me; I became irrelevant. The moon was the minute hand, the seasons the hour hand. I didn’t even have a name. I never felt lonely. To put it romantically: I was completely free.” “I suspect, more damage has been done to my sanity in jail, in months; than years, decades, in the woods.”&nbsp;<strong>– Christopher Knight&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>3 Life Lessons from Christopher Knight</h2><p>Let’s look at some of the things we can learn from Christopher Knight now that you are familiar with his achievements and net worth:</p><h3>1.
