Unfortunately, caught in the middle of this mental health crisis fueled by tabloid speculation were her children, Jayden and Sean Federline.</p><p>Britney shares her children with her ex, Kevin Federline, and she has a strained relationship with him and her sons alike. She has made it clear online that she's open to fostering a parental connection with them, but reportedly to no avail.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@jayden_federline</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Where is Jayden Federline now?</h2><p>Jayden's life was made publicly forcibly due to his mother's status. Now, he's starting to get the opportunity to make his own decisions in life, albeit still monitored by his father.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, Kevin moved his sons and wife to Hawaii on Aug. 1, 2023. Rumors quickly spread that he did so to extend child support payments from Britney due to a change in state laws.</p><p>However, Kevin adamantly denied this, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>. He told a paparazzo that “a lot of people say a lot of stupid things." Regardless of the decision behind the move, that's where Jayden now resides as he rebuilds a new life alongside his family.</p><p>As for Jayden's relationship with his mother, a future reconciliation isn't off the table. “I 100 percent think it can be fixed, of course. It’s just going to take a lot of time and effort. I really want to see her again," he said in an ITV interview in 2022.</p><p>One claim suggests that Kevin is looking to steer his boys away from that Hollywood lifestyle. “It’s an opportunity for Kevin and his wife, and the boys are ready to get away from the LA microscope," his lawyer told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> about the Hawaii move. However, it looks like Jayden is craving it as he teases new music.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Is Jayden Federline releasing music?</h2><p>Despite his mother's fame, Jayden doesn't have much of a following or a name for himself, especially since he doesn't share his pop idol mom's trademark last name.</p><p>However, Jayden does seem to have picked up his parents' creative bones, especially Britney's passion for music. He has made a few posts insinuating that could be the direction for his career.</p><p>As of this writing, Jayden hasn't made a formal announcement about releasing his own music. In fact, so far it seems that he might just be happy focusing on production rather than songwriting.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jayden teased his music with two cryptic Instagram posts.</h2><p>The child star keeps a pretty empty Instagram. Recently, though, he began posting again which could point to a desire to build a brand for himself or a potential music career.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by @jayden_federline</a></p></figure><p>While one of Jayden's posts was just a general, caption-less photo of himself, the other was music-oriented. He posted a clip of himself at a soundboard doing some mixing. He captioned the post: "#producer #beats #synthesizer."</p><p>Otherwise, his Instagram activity is relatively quiet and he's only garnered a following of around 25K which, for a small artist, would be a lot. However, for Britney Spears's son, not so much.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BqwM2esGaroJqus7%2BMrKanZZqWxqWxzWalqK8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
