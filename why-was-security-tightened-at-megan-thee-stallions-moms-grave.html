First, Megan Thee Stallion’s <a href=#>song “HISS</a>” referenced <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Megan’s Law, </a>which mandates the public release of information about registered sex offenders. In 2020, Minaj’s husband, Kenneth Petty, received three years probation after failing to register as a sex offender in California, stemming from a 1995 rape conviction.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>Minaj shot back at Megan with “Big Foot,” a song that seems to refer to the 2020 incident in which rapper <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Torey Lanez shot Minaj in the foot</a>. The Minaj track also included the lyric, “Lyin’ on your dead mama, on-on your dead mama,” which many interpreted to mean Megan’s late mother, <a href=#>Holly Thomas</a>. Thomas died from brain cancer in 2019, and is buried at a Houston cemetery.</p><h2 id=h-minaj-also-mentioned-megan-s-mom-on-social-media data-injectable=false>Minaj also mentioned Megan’s mom on social media</h2><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=784 data-injectable=true>Putting Megan Thee Stallion’s mom front and center in the feud, Nicki Minaj also wrote <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a since-deleted post aimed at Megan on X</a>, alluding to Megan’s mom. According to TMZ, Minaj also said on the streaming platform Stationhead: “You better go conjure up your mother and apologize. That’s disgusting,” referring to Megan Thee Stallion’s track, “HISS.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Megan’s mom’s grave location leaked online</h2><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>Amid the beef between the two rappers, their sizable fandoms naturally picked sides, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbz</a> — as Nick Minaj fans are called — doxxed the location of Mega Thee Stallion’s mom’s gravesite, calling for vandalism. Once Houston authorities were notified, security was heightened at the cemetery, but as of this writing, no incidents have been reported.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>Megan Thee Stallion’s been pretty open about how much her mom meant to her and influenced her career in music. So, in our view, bringing a dead mother into the war of words has gone too far. Minaj and Megan Thee Stallion have not publically commented on the Thomas grave controversy.</p><p data-characters=1 data-current-count=1 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wn7Jlp5bAbr%2FEnKyroaSuerW1xqGrnqaVmXqiwIymnKCZnmLBqbHEZqqtmZyhtrC60makqKWjYrSzrdWeZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
