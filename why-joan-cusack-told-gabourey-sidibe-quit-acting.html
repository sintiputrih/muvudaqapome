But&nbsp;after the film? She truly became famous; the role was hard-hitting, and critics were impressed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though she clearly didn't listen to anyone who told her she couldn't become a successful actress, Gabourey has confirmed there've been plenty of detractors throughout her decade-plus in Hollywood.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gabourey Sidibe Catches Heat For Announcing Engagement To White Man</a></span></p><p>In fact, Joan Cusack was one of the first big-wigs to tell Gabourey that Hollywood didn't have a place for her. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Spy</a> explained, before she became well-known from her first movie, she ran into Joan Cusack at "some industry party."</p><p>Sidibe, answering the question of what celebrity was she disappointed by upon meeting them, said that though Joan Cusack is her "favourite favourite," the famous lady's words weren't the sweetest.</p><p>Gabourey maintained that "it's not in a mean way, because I know that she meant well," but that Joan straight-up told her to stop acting. She said that Joan asked if she was an actress, and when Gabourey said that she was, Joan's response was crushing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joan apparently said 'Oh honey, you should really quit the business, it's so image-conscious.' With her long list of experience in Hollywood, including time spent doing everything from a small role in 'Sixteen Candles' to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">voicing a character on 'Toy Story'</a> to acting in&nbsp;award-winning pieces like 'Shameless,' some would have taken Joan's advice to heart.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Eighties Stars We (Almost) Forgot About And Where They Are Now</a></span></p><p>As fans know now, Joan's comments — however well-meaning — may have stung at first, but they clearly didn't stop Sidibe from pursuing her dreams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After 'Precious,' Gabourey had a few roles in films, netted a role on 'The Big C' that lasted three years, acted in 'Difficult People' for two years, and then enjoyed a recurring role on 'American Horror Story' (and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the cast of&nbsp;the show has plenty to say about working on the series</a>). She&nbsp;also acted in 'Empire' for a five-year run, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a> highlights.</p><p>In short, Joan may have had Gabourey's feelings in mind, but she may have underestimated the actress's actual acting ability. Especially given Gabourey's recent performance in 'Antebellum.'</p><p>Though fans may not have seen Gabourey in the headlines much recently (apart from backlash over her engagement), she's still working a ton in Hollywood. In addition to her long resume on IMDb, Gabourey is also due to voice act in an upcoming CBS show, 'The Harper House.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gabourey has also won an impressively long list of awards — tons of them for 'Precious,' of course. But also for her work on 'Seven Psychopaths,' 'The Big C,' and 'American Horror Story: Coven.'</p><p>And for fans who can't get enough of Sidibe and want to hear her story in her own words, she's also written a memoir. It's called 'This Is Just My Face: Try Not to Stare.' and came out in 2017. Critics call it "wise, complex, smart, funny" and it sounds just like Gabourey Sidibe herself.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Horror Story: Ages, Heights and Relationship Statuses Of The Main Cast</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdn7yiuoycrKyZk6B6tbvLnWSgmZKkwrOx2GaqopyZl7JuvdSiq2aZk6m2r7OO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
