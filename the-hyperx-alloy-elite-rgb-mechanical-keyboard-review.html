By measuring the actuation force of every key, the quality and consistency of the keyboard can be quantified. It can also reveal design issues, such as the larger keys being far softer to press than the main keys of the keyboard. The actuation force is measured in Centinewton (cN). Some companies use another figure, gram-force (gf). The conversion formula is 1 cN = 1.02 gf (i.e. they are about the same). A high-quality keyboard should be as consistent as possible, with an average actuation force as near to the manufacturer's specs as possible and a disparity of less than ±10%. Greater differences are likely to be perceptible by users. It is worth noting that there is typically variance among keyboards, although most keyboard companies will try and maintain consistency - as with other reviews, we're testing our sample only.</p><p>The machine we use for our testing is accurate enough to provide readings with a resolution of 0.1 cN. For wider keys (e.g. Enter, Space Bar, etc.), the measurement is taking place at the center of the key, right above the switch. Note that large keys generally have a lower actuation force even if the actuation point is at the dead center of the key. This is natural, as the size and weight of the keycap reduce the required actuation force. For this reason, we do display the force required to actuate every key but we only use the results of the typically sized keys for our consistency calculations. Still, very low figures on medium sized keys, such as the Shift and Enter keys reveal design issues and can easily be perceptible by the user.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/13894/TestB.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Cherry’s MX switches never surprise us, showing nearly identical figures on every keyboard that we have tested to this date. HyperX's Alloy Elite RGB is very consistent, with the disparity across the main keys barely reaching ± 2.7%. At this point, we should note that very rarely we get such consistency figures from keyboards without genuine Cherry MX switches. The average actuation force of the standard keys is 45 cN, matching exactly the manufacturer’s specifications.</p><h2>Hands-on Testing</h2><p>I always try to use every keyboard that we review as my personal keyboard for at least a week. My typical weekly usage includes a lot of typing (about 100-150 pages), a few hours of gaming and some casual usage, such as internet browsing and messaging. I tend to prefer Cherry MX Brown or similar (tactile) switches for such tasks but, personally, I am also well accustomed to the quietness and linearity of the Cherry MX Red switch. Even though they lack tactile feedback, Cherry’s MX switches are comfortable for professional use and long typing sessions due to the low travel force and respectable travel. Some users need some time to get used to them because their low travel force makes is easy to bottom down the key hard, stressing muscles and tendons, forcing the users to lower their keystroke force. While Cherry’s MX Red RGB switches lack tactile feedback, they also are relatively quiet, greatly increasing the acoustic comfort of the user and of everyone in the immediate vicinity. These switches perhaps are the only plausible choice for a mechanical keyboard in shared/office environments.</p><p>When it comes to gaming, the Alloy Elite RGB performs exactly as intended. The keyboard is very comfortable for long gaming sessions, especially in games where long keystrokes or very quick keystrokes are common, as the relatively low actuation force will not stress the user’s hands. Regardless of their low actuation force, the keys reset quickly and reliably, making the keyboard very responsive to repeated rapid keystrokes. The per-key programmability should work miracles for advanced users, professionals and gamers alike. Only very specific groups of gamers may be disappointed by the limiting macro recorder but, if necessary, this obstacle can be bypassed by using a third-party macro generator.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH50hJhtZq2glWK1urzEq69mmZyhvLp5xKWgrZ1dp7SjecyemqGZnp6woriMpJyymp%2BWv6V50Z6top2nZIE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
